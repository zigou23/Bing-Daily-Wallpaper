This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent."

Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration."

This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy."

Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. These messages highlight theatre's role in society—be it as a mirror to reality, an agent of change, or a refuge for the imagination. From Shakespeare's soliloquies to experimental avant-garde productions, theatre has continuously evolved while holding onto its core: human connection."

March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. This day was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore JRR Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favourite moments and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?"

Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 134-metre summit for breathtaking panoramic views."

Today is the Ides of March, a day steeped in Roman history and tradition. The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life."

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honour today."

The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image. Experts believe they climb to escape ground-level heat or pesky insects, but these naps make for an unforgettable sight. This vast park spans volcanic craters, open plains and dense forests. A safari here promises encounters with Uganda's incredible wildlife."

Rising 310 metres above England's capital, this glass-clad giant is not just the tallest building in the United Kingdom but also a symbol of modern London. It was designed by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect known for making a statement with high-tech, lightweight and functional designs. Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009, and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper."

From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate."

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 13 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."

Saint David was a 6th-century monk, bishop and preacher who played a key role in spreading Christianity across the country. He founded several religious communities known for their simple, disciplined lifestyles. One of his most famous sayings, 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain,' still resonates today as a reminder that small acts of kindness and faith matter. But why do people wear leeks and daffodils? Legend has it that the saint advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets to distinguish themselves from the enemy in battle against the Saxons. The daffodil, meanwhile, became popular later as a more visually appealing national emblem, especially during the 19th century."

The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,600 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern."

Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

This massive marine sinkhole, 318 metres across and 125 metres deep, was formed during the last ice age when a limestone cave system collapsed and rising sea levels flooded the area, leaving behind this striking natural wonder."

Once called Jorvik, York was a major Viking settlement, and this festival, which is taking place from 17 to 23 February this year, brings that era to life with battle reenactments, storytelling and hands-on activities. The highlight? Epic clashes of costumed warriors in dramatic, historically accurate battles. For a more peaceful experience, visitors can try axe-throwing, learn rune writing, or explore Viking markets brimming with crafts and treats. Traditional Scandinavian foods and mead-tasting sessions let you feast like a Viking chieftain."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material."

The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 and 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. They spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival."

As you walk through its streets, you'll notice façades adorned with azulejos—painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework found in Portugal and Spain—historic churches like São Francisco, and the iconic Dom Luís I Bridge, which spans the Douro River, which runs through the city."

As we celebrate the anniversary of its establishment today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves, created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast forward 266 years, the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artefacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes and samurai armour."

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples.

Welcome to the Namib desert, spanning thousands of miles across Namibia. Estimated to be 55 million years old, it is believed to be the oldest desert in the world. It also boasts some of the tallest sand dunes on Earth, including the famous 'Big Daddy,' which towers roughly 325 metres; Dune 7, the highest dune in Namibia at 383 metres; and Dune 45, which, at roughly 170 metres, is a favourite among photographers."

Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength."

Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history. The United Kingdom, with its rich geological diversity, provides a front-row seat to the ancient forces that shaped our planet. On the Jurassic Coast in Dorset and East Devon, rocks over 180 million years old tell tales of dinosaurs, ancient seas and volcanic activity. And don't forget the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its impressive columns of basalt."

Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or a burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

In the United Kingdom, some of these birds were brought in as exotic pets and either escaped or were released. Parakeets are often spotted in flocks, chattering melodiously or indulging in their favourite fruits, seeds and blossoms. Their quick, agile flight and playful nature make them a delight in the wild or as beloved pets. Known for their distinctive calls that echo through the air, these birds are also capable of mimicking human speech."

Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

But what it means today is clear: an unmissable celebration filled with fireworks, folk songs and feasting. This year, the festivities kicked off on December 29 with a dramatic torchlight procession."

Green sea turtles have been recorded in Britain and Ireland, including the south and west coasts of England, and the north-west of Scotland and Shetland. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrate. This coral can grow to around 2 metres and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over."

        "description": "As the year winds down and the longest night of winter settles over Brighton in England, the city doesn't hibernate—it ignites. Burning the Clocks, a winter solstice festival, is Brighton's luminous way of letting go of the past year, lighting up the darkest hours with paper lanterns, a blazing bonfire and an explosion of creativity. This tradition was born in 1994 as a response to the commercialised chaos of the holiday season. This annual fest invites locals and visitors alike to create intricate paper lanterns symbolising their hopes, dreams and reflections from the year gone by. These lanterns are paraded through the streets in a procession that winds its way to Brighton Beach, accompanied by music. At the end of the parade, the lanterns are ceremoniously burned on a massive bonfire."

Sparkling strings of lights drape across the square, seen in today's image, creating a canopy that bathes the cobblestone streets in a warm, festive glow. There also stands a beautifully lit Christmas tree, surrounded by charming wooden huts selling everything from handcrafted ornaments to locally made treats like cozonac, a traditional Romanian sweet bread; vin fiert, an aromatic mulled wine; and covrigi, a type of pretzel served warm and sprinkled with salt."

Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here."

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

At more than 1,700 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than 1.5 miles. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species."

In fact, their name even comes from the Quechua word 'huanaco,' meaning a wild animal or an animal that runs fast. And run they do, at up to 35 miles per hour!"

However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

While these towers can be found in many places, today's image showcases them at Mono Lake in Mono County, California, United States. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981 by the California State Legislature."

        "description": "Have you ever experienced the awe of seeing an Alaskan moose? The largest moose species, these creatures can weigh between 300 and 650 kilograms, reaching heights of up to 2 metres at the shoulder. Male moose are called bulls, females are known as cows, and their young are referred to as calves. One thing that really sets moose apart is their incredible antlers, which are only sported by the males."

This day honours the spirit of global cooperation, reminding us of the collective responsibility to protect the planet's last great wilderness."

Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred."

The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims and invaders alike."

Designed by the renowned architect Norman Foster, this twisting masterpiece adds a dramatic flair to the glassy building that opened in 2002 and served as the headquarters for the Greater London Authority until 2021. The 500-metre walkway follows the curve of the building to reduce noise pollution and echoes. This spiral structure ascends through the entire ten-storey building, offering visitors an immersive architectural experience. With each curve, the staircase allows people to see across different levels, which is not just a structural feature but was a symbol of government transparency and openness. So, next time you're in the area, take a spin on this helix of history and marvel at how it elevates the everyday into the extraordinary."

The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."

From there, they were spread to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then further afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood and fruit for millennia."

He's most famous, however, for his sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...

Featured here is a pair of African lion cubs sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa. Typically born in litters of one to four, they are tucked away in a secluded den for safety. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride. This isn't just a casual interaction—it's an important moment for them to socialise and find their place in the group. During this time, they learn how to behave within the pride, which helps shape their roles as they grow up. After they hit six months, they begin to accompany adults on hunting trips, learning essential skills and tricks of the trade through real-life adventures."

This park is home to several unique flowering plants, as well as Australian fur seals and little penguins. Dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite are a key feature of this area. The Tasmans Arch in today's image is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock."

Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalised in the verses of Italian poets."

California sea lions, like the one pictured, are a common sight basking in the sun along the rocky shores of North America's western coast. These marine mammals, belonging to the pinniped group, are often mistaken for seals. An easy way to distinguish between them is by looking at their ears—sea lions have visible flaps, seals don't."

The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, photographed through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans nearly 44 metres and is over 30 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches."

At 11 a.m. on the day, a two-minute silence is observed. This moment serves as a national pause to reflect and remember.

This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh. Perched on a hillside by the Ounila River, this village is a cluster of buildings encircled by a protective wall, complete with towers and a gate."

The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

This unique subspecies of the grey wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

The tale begins in 1605, when a man named Guy Fawkes became part of a conspiracy to blow up the Houses of Parliament on November 5. Alongside a group of disillusioned Catholics, Fawkes had hatched a bold and dangerous plan to kill King James I and end Protestant rule in England. Their secret weapon? Thirty-six barrels of gunpowder hidden in the cellars of Parliament, enough to blow the entire place sky-high. However, the plan was discovered a day before and the plot foiled. And so, 5 November became a day of celebration—not of the plotters, but of their failure. Today, communities gather to burn effigies of Fawkes, light fireworks and enjoy treats like bonfire toffee, remembering the night the plot went up in smoke—literally!"

Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

While the idea of summer time was mentioned in 1784 by American inventor Benjamin Franklin, the first serious proposal for changing the clocks in the United Kingdom came from British builder William Willett in 1907. He valued having more daylight and felt so strongly about this that he published a pamphlet called 'The Waste of Daylight. Over time, many countries adopted the practice to give people more daylight in the evenings during the summer months."

The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

Bodie was named after WS Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

In today's image, we're transported to the George L Smith State Park, which spans 1,634 acres (661 hectares) in Emanuel County, Georgia, United States. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 412-acre (167-hectare) mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the United States. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which light from sunrises and sunsets hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."

It's like a giant natural history museum, with rocks and cliffs that reveal 185 million years of Earth's history. But what really steals the show are the fossils, especially those of belemnites and ammonites—extinct marine creatures—that are pictured here. Mary Anning, a pioneering fossil hunter who combed these shores, paved the way for our current understanding of fossils. Lyme Regis and Charmouth are hotspots for fossil hunting. In these towns, you'll find beaches where fossils practically wash up at your feet. The coast's rock formations are more than just pretty to look at—they're iconic. Durdle Door, a natural limestone arch, and Old Harry Rocks, a set of chalk formations near Swanage, are some of the examples."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

A tradition since 1994, it unites people from bustling cities to serene lochs in a celebration of verse on the first Thursday of every October. Founded by William Sieghart, this event aims to make poetry more visible and engaging. It's a day when Prince Charles might recite Seamus Heaney, and train announcement boards become stanzas of TS Eliot and Auden. Everyday spaces transform into stages for the spoken word—a railway station or supermarket might suddenly echo with an epic. This year the special day focuses on the theme of 'counting.' So today, our image of Loch Morlich in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland provides the perfect backdrop for finding poetic inspiration. Why not let poetry alight upon your day?"

The initiative was spearheaded by Ghanaian activist Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, who recognised the need for a dedicated time to reflect on Black history in Britain. This movement has since grown, and today, it's a cornerstone of our cultural calendar.

Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 3.6 metres long and weigh more than 1,180 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

This tomb is the centrepiece of a sprawling 42-acre (17-hectare) complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles."

Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also nearly 11 metres wide.

Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater. Surrounded by dark lava columns that resemble a heart from afar, this waterfall inspired the design of Iceland's National Theatre and the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík.

The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Weighing 14-45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species."

The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun."

The origin of this holiday goes back to a 1995 joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers. During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, today be for all to enjoy. So, batten down the hatches, set sail and remember: on this day, everyone can be a pirate."

Originally constructed in 1559, this castle has witnessed centuries of Japanese history, including the rise and fall of powerful clans. It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

        "description": "For many Asian cultures, the point at which the moon reaches its fullest during the harvest season marks the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival. It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes and hues, symbolising good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales."

        "description": "Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia. These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 104 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

Designed by architect Erik Gunnar Asplund in the 1920s, this Nordic Classicist composition features the geometry of a cylinder intersecting a cubic base. Its accessible façade belies a treasure trove within a 360-degree rotunda, inviting even the casual reader into a literal circle of knowledge."

This annual event, held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, pictured here, is the grand finale of the BBC Proms season. The Proms, short for 'Promenade Concerts,' began in 1895 with the aim of making classical music accessible to everyone. It started with just a few concerts, but it has grown into a summer-long festival featuring hundreds of performances from July to September. The Last Night typically kicks off with a selection of classical favourites performed by top orchestras and soloists. Expect the second half of the evening to get properly patriotic, with anthems like 'Land of Hope and Glory' and 'Rule, Britannia!,' inspiring a joyous sing-along. So, put on your best concert attire or a flag cape and get ready to join in the fun!"

The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

Measuring up to 30 centimetres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges.

These gentle giants have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the 1820s. As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life."

Today's image takes us to Castellfollit de la Roca in the Catalonia region of northeastern Spain. This town is not for the faint-hearted: there's a 49-metre drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia Rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. Fast forward to the 1900s, which saw innovation skyrocket with coasters looping the loop for the first time."

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres. It even has its own weather system; clouds form inside the cave due to temperature differences between the cave air and the outside air."
