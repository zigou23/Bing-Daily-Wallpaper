        "description": "Cute, clumsy and completely captivating, penguins steal the show today. World Penguin Day is all about celebrating these flightless birds while raising awareness about their habitats. This day originated at McMurdo Station, an American research centre on Ross Island in Antarctica, where scientists observed Adélie penguins starting their yearly migration around this time. Inspired by this natural event, the observance was created to shed light on penguins' role in the ecosystem, the threats they face and the urgency of protecting their habitats."

        "description": "Today, let's turn our attention to Kenai Fjords National Park, a gem on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula in the United States. Stretching over 2,590 square kilometres, this landscape features towering fjords, winding river valleys and alpine landscapes. More than half of its terrain is blanketed in ice, with glaciers dominating 51% of its area. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons."

        "description": "'All the world's a stage ...' and only a few have shaped that stage like William Shakespeare. Every April 23, we celebrate Shakespeare Day, honouring one of England's greatest playwrights and poets. This date is special as it marks both his birth and death. Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionised English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Even four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge and inspire."

        "description": "On Earth Day, let's journey to one of nature's most stunning displays of geothermal power—Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The largest hot spring in the United States, it spans 113 metres across and reaches temperatures of 71°C. This geothermal marvel is fuelled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters."

        "description": "Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon. This is the experience International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), people are encouraged to gaze at the stars. The event was founded in 2003 by Jennifer Barlow, an American high school student, to raise awareness of light pollution. One of the best places to experience a pristine night sky in the United States is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did."

Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny! Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today in various countries. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' would visit children and leave behind decorated eggs as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!"

It became a national park in 1919, but its history stretches much further back. The Ancestral Puebloans and later the Southern Paiute people lived here, relying on the Virgin River. Evidence of their presence remains in petroglyphs and archaeological sites. Today, the river continues to carve through the landscape, creating canyons that attract hikers and climbers."
