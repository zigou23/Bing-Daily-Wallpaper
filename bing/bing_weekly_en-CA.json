        "description": "They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground and hold hands while they nap. Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild."

        "description": "Ever wanted to swim in the ocean without accidentally tasting half of it? Enter Mona Vale rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched between two beaches—The Basin beach and Mona Vale Beach—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a man-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is more than 30 metres long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools were also used by large numbers of World War II troops who camped nearby. They are free, open year-round and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

        "description": "Drive up Mount Hamilton in the Bay Area, California, United States, and immerse yourself in stunning views and rich history. The 31-kilometre Mount Hamilton Road is part of State Route 130. It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at 1,300 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day."

        "description": "What began as an abandoned quarry over a century ago now transforms into a living colour wheel each spring. Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, tulips scent the air, colour lines the paths and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1912. Now spread across 220,000 square metres, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom."

Created by the EUROPARC Federation in 1999, this day commemorates the founding of Europe's first national parks—a set of nine parks established in Sweden in 1909. It promotes efforts to protect natural habitats, wildlife and cultural heritage while encouraging sustainable tourism and outdoor activities."

        "description": "No need to hurry, because today marks the 25th anniversary of World Turtle Day. Turtles and tortoises thrive in a variety of environments and are linked to wisdom and perseverance. All tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. While turtles are smaller and built for swimming, tortoises are larger, heavier and adapted for life on land. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats."

        "description": "Life on Earth, from tiny bacteria to towering trees, is interconnected. International Day for Biological Diversity is about celebrating this web of life that keeps our planet thriving. Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. A decline in biodiversity can increase the spread of zoonotic diseases—those transmitted from animals to humans. In contrast, protecting biodiversity strengthens our ability to prevent and respond to health crises like pandemics. Recognising its crucial role for current and future generations, the United Nations observes this day each year to raise awareness and foster action for conserving the planet's biological treasures"
