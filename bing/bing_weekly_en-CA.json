        "description": "With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring. The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms."

        "description": "In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image. While fishing, the heron dips its head, extends its wings around its body and forms a shaded canopy."

        "description": "Sedona, Arizona, is a place where nature, history and spirituality converge amidst stunning red rock formations. These fiery sandstone creations, part of the Schnebly Hill Formation, were shaped over millions of years during the Permian Period as sediment accumulated in an ancient sea. Over time, erosion has further sculpted Sedona's landscapes, which now glow brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. Notable formations such as Wilson Mountain, Seven Sacred Pools and Cathedral Rock offer iconic views."

        "description": "St. Patrick's Day, celebrated on March 17, honours Ireland's patron saint and national apostle, Saint Patrick—a fifth-century missionary. A national holiday in Ireland, the festivity is marked by a range of cultural events, parades and traditional music and dance enjoyed across the globe. Interestingly, the first St. Patrick's Day parade wasn't held in Ireland but in the United States. The earliest celebration was organised by Irish vicar Ricardo Artur in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1601. Canada's first St. Patrick's Day parade was held in Montreal in 1824. Here, the festival dates to the 17th century, when Irish immigrants brought their traditions to cities like Montreal and Toronto. Today, major cities such as Toronto, Vancouver and St. John's hold large events featuring bagpipes, dancing and Guinness-fuelled festivities. Pubs fill up early, and landmarks glow green to mark the occasion."

They play a crucial role in their bamboo forest ecosystem by dispersing seeds and fostering new vegetation growth, which benefits countless plants and animals."

Every spring, over 14,500 grey whales swim along the Pacific Coast on their annual migration from Mexico's Baja Peninsula to the Arctic, covering 13,000 kilometres. The Pacific Rim Whale Festival marks this natural event with a week-long celebration in Tofino, Ucluelet and the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Started in the 1980s, the festival was brought to life to raise awareness about marine conservation and to celebrate the coastal environment."

This date was chosen because 3, 1 and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1,900 BCE."
