        "description": "Perched dramatically on a tidal islet in Loch Laich, Argyll, Castle Stalker is one of Scotland's most picturesque and well-preserved medieval tower houses. Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. Despite falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer."

        "description": "A breathtaking maze of sandstone formations and awe-inspiring views awaits you at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, United States. People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote."

        "description": "Prepare to be amazed by the giant cuttlefish, known for its mesmerising ability to transform its appearance in the blink of an eye. This cuttlefish is found in the temperate and subtropical waters of Australia, ranging from Brisbane in Queensland and Shark Bay in Western Australia to as far south as Tasmania. Featured here is a giant cuttlefish in Whyalla, South Australia. In this region, where males are significantly outnumbered, a unique gender imbalance fuels intense competition for mating rights."

        "description": "Around 100 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises over 3,700 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and over-tourism has become a real concern."

        "description": "Today we are at the Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson's idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 192-metre-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, epics composed as poems and set in the ancient Hindu kingdoms of India. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva,' the Hindu god. It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva, and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats mountain range."
