        "description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Interestingly, tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

        "description": "April 10 rolls around, and suddenly, childhood rivalries, inside jokes and borrowed clothes come flooding back. Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Although Siblings Day is not a federally recognised holiday, it has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. Since 1995, the Siblings Day Foundation has worked to celebrate this occasion and the unique connection shared by brothers and sisters."

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky."

Called Algar de Benagil in Portuguese, this sea cave, seen in today's image, draws adventurers, photographers and nature enthusiasts from across the world. With its limestone walls, circular skylight and turquoise waters, its inside looks like a natural cathedral."

These tiny songbirds, like many others, bring a pop of colour to the Canadian landscape every spring, sticking around through summer.  Hopping from branch to branch, they spend their day feasting on insects like caterpillars and beetles."

        "description": "Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. It is famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen."
