        "description": "Every May, Canadians roll out the red carpet and prep the fireworks for a queen who never set foot here. Victoria Day marks Queen Victoria's birthday—24 May—and has been observed since 1845, celebrated on the Monday preceding that date. Officially recognised as a holiday in the mid-19th century, it's a nod to the country's colonial roots and a reminder of the queen's lasting influence. It's more than just a long weekend; for many, it marks the unofficial start of summer, with parades, picnics and festivities across the country, particularly in British Columbia."

        "description": "This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 600 square metres fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications."

        "description": "Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 550 square kilometres, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

        "description": "London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 12,000 kilograms bell inside. It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower to Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans more than 6 metres, with the minute hands measuring roughly 4 metres. At 90 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament."

        "description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process."

Established in 1886, Yoho National Park in British Columbia is known for its towering cliffs, glacial lakes and thunderous waterfalls. It's the second oldest national park in Canada and part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. Covering 1,313 square kilometres, the park is home to the Burgess Shale, a globally recognised fossil site. It consists of well-preserved marine life dating back over 500 million years—vital to understanding early evolution."
