        "description": "On Earth Day, let's journey to one of nature's most stunning displays of geothermal power—Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. The largest hot spring in the United States, it spans 113 metres across and reaches temperatures of 71°C. This geothermal marvel is fuelled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters."

        "description": "Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon. This is the experience International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), people are encouraged to gaze at the stars. The event was founded in 2003 by Jennifer Barlow, an American high school student, to raise awareness of light pollution. One of the best places to experience a pristine night sky in the United States is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did."

        "description": "Happy Easter! Today is a special day for billions of Christians worldwide—a time of renewal, celebration and traditions. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny! Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today in various countries. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' would visit children and leave behind decorated eggs as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!"

        "description": "Standing in Zion National Park in Utah, United States, it is impossible not to feel small. Massive sandstone cliffs, sculpted over millions of years, rise towards the sky. It became a national park in 1919, but its history stretches much further back. The Ancestral Puebloans and later the Southern Paiute people lived here, relying on the Virgin River. Evidence of their presence remains in petroglyphs and archaeological sites. Today, the river continues to carve through the landscape, creating canyons that attract hikers and climbers."

That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too."

They look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too."

        "description": "Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah in the United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse. Today, this monument remains a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years."
