        "description": "Feeling a bit tired? You're not alone—losing an hour to daylight saving time can leave anyone groggy. That's why Napping Day exists. Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help."

        "description": "It's that time of year again—when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy. Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximising daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularised by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving us eight months of extended evening light."

First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate."

These flowers of the Prunus mume tree bloom in late winter to early spring. Native to China, the tree has also been introduced to Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Found in China's iconic spots like Nanjing's Plum Blossom Mountain, Wuhan's East Lake and Hangzhou's West Lake, these fleeting blooms attract visitors eager to witness their ephemeral magic. In Chinese culture, these blossoms represent purity and the arrival of spring, whereas in Japan, they symbolise new beginnings. With over 300 varieties, this tree can thrive in gardens of all sizes, offering a variety of shapes and colours. Beyond their visual appeal, plum blossoms are also used to flavour traditional cuisine, such as floral teas and tangy preserved plums. So, why not take the chance to branch out and experience them for yourself?"

It's a place of long winters, festival-packed summers and a love for hockey that runs deep. The North Saskatchewan River, once a transport route, now defines the city's outdoor spaces. If you've been to Edmonton, you've probably seen the Walterdale Bridge–that sleek, steel arch that stands tall over the river. Opened in 2017, this bridge replaced an ageing structure—named after John Walter, a Canadian business entrepreneur and an early settler in Fort Edmonton—that was constructed in 1913 by the Dominion Bridge Company. The new design features an impressive, curved arch, making it one of Edmonton's most modern and striking bridges. More than just a way to cross the river, it connects key parts of the city, making travel between the capital's downtown and Southside easier and faster."

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive. In Canada, they inhabit the Rocky Mountains, including parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon."

The country's tallest mountain rises over 3,700 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and over-tourism has become a real concern."

Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."

Today, it urges global action on threats like ocean pollution, climate change and habitat loss."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 18,180 square kilometres, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world, including the United States. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material."

We rely on the prognostication skills of Willie to determine if winter will hang on. Legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow on February 2 and sees his own shadow, Canadians brace for an extended winter; no shadow means an early spring is on the way. Though it is celebrated mostly in Ontario, other places like Nova Scotia and Quebec also take part in the fun. The tradition has deep roots, first appearing in the early 1800s when European settlers brought similar customs to North America. Historically, Europeans celebrated today as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers."

Steeped in thousands of years of tradition, this holiday marks the start of the lunisolar Chinese calendar. One of the most captivating images associated with this festival is the dragon dance, pictured here. This is a mesmerising performance where skilled dancers manipulate a long, flexible dragon puppet, bringing it to life with sinuous, undulating movements. The dragon, a symbol of power, dignity and good fortune, is believed to bring luck to the community, with longer dragons bringing even more prosperity."

Found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, it is one of the most widely distributed bird species. This winged bird is found across Canada, primarily in open habitats such as grasslands, prairies and wetlands. This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their heads. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive. Because of its irregular wingbeats, its flight is on the floppy side, much like a moth or bat. It likes to glide a few metres above the ground in open fields and grasslands, swooping down feet-first to grab its prey"

Since then, the river has been deepening and widening the canyon while sculpting its dramatic geographical features."

With its smooth grey bark, short trunk and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 50-metre tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring and even kitchen tools. Wildlife such as black bears, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks and mice love them too—beech nuts, though slightly bitter, provide a feast for all kinds of critters. In winter, the beech forests in Belgium become even more enchanting."

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

        "description": "Ever heard of frozen bubbles? Abraham Lake in Alberta, has them during the winter, and they're not just beautiful—they're science in action. Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 53 square kilometres along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum."

Welcome to the Namib desert, spanning thousands of kilometres across Namibia. Estimated to be 55 million years old, it is believed to be the oldest desert in the world. It also boasts some of the tallest sand dunes on Earth, including the famous 'Big Daddy,' which towers roughly 325 metres; Dune 7, the highest dune in Namibia at 383 metres; and Dune 45, which, at roughly 170 metres, is a favourite among photographers."

One of the longest manmade structures in the world, this wall stretches over 20,900 kilometres and dates back thousands of years. Back then, glutinous rice flour was used to bind the bricks of the wall. The ancient marvel depicted in today's picture consists of a series of fortifications that span rugged mountains, valleys and deserts. Featuring watchtowers and garrison stations, some sections were designed to keep invaders at bay. This wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Hiking offers a unique glimpse of this historical landmark. The experience ranges from well-preserved sections, like Mutianyu, to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high they feel more like climbing a ladder!"

Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how remarkable they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms. Canada is home to some jaw-dropping geological wonders. Take Hopewell Rocks in New Brunswick, for example. These giant, flowerpot-like formations were carved by the Bay of Fundy's massive tides, which rise and fall by up to 14 metres daily. Then there's the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec. This collection of limestone monoliths, shaped by waves and wind, is over 450 million years old."

Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt or a burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

Birds come in many shapes and colours, but few are as striking as the plum-headed parakeet photographed at Shimoga, Karnataka, India, in today's image. Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are known for their swift, acrobatic flight and distinctive calls that echo through the air. These calls help them stay connected while foraging or alerting the flock to nearby threats. Breeding starts around February, peaking by April to June. These birds are cavity nesters, often using hollowed-out tree trunks to lay their eggs. Both parents play a role in feeding and protecting the chicks. If you ever meet them, be mindful of your words because they are sneaky mimics and might just pick up a word or two."

Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

They are rarely found in Canada because they prefer warmer, tropical and subtropical waters, which Canadian waters do not provide. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrates. This coral can grow to around 2 metres and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over."

Among many beautiful examples on San Diego's Christmas Tree Trail is the 6-metre tree at the end of a festively decorated Crystal Pier."

This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

Sparkling strings of lights drape across the square, seen in today's image, creating a canopy that bathes the cobblestone streets in a warm, festive glow. There also stands a beautifully lit Christmas tree, surrounded by charming wooden huts selling everything from handcrafted ornaments to locally made treats like cozonac, a traditional Romanian sweet bread; vin fiert, an aromatic mulled wine; and covrigi, a type of pretzel served warm and sprinkled with salt."

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

At more than 1,740 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than 2 kilometres. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species."

Standing around 110 centimetres tall and weighing up to 90 kilograms, guanacos travel in herds led by a dominant male, accompanied by females and their young. After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized. It is used to create luxury fabrics and is valued second only to vicuña wool across the Americas."

The largest moose species, these creatures can weigh between 317 and 635 kilograms, reaching heights of up to 2 metres at the shoulder. Male moose are called bulls, females are known as cows and their young are referred to as calves. One thing that sets moose apart is their incredible antlers, which are only sported by the males."

Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred."

The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims and invaders alike."

The park is home to Assiniboine Lodge, the first ski lodge in the Canadian Rockies, built in 1928. With no road access, anyone who wants to visit the park must either hike or take a helicopter ride, making the journey an adventure in itself. But the effort is worth it: this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts stunning landscapes, from glaciers and lakes to towering peaks and limestone caves. There are multiple hiking trails that will take trekkers through forests, across meadows and up mountains. It's also a popular spot for cross-country skiing and alpine mountaineering. If you're looking for a place where every view is a masterpiece, Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park may just be it."

The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."

From there, they were spread to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then further afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood and fruit for millennia."

He's most famous, however, for his sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...

The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalised in the verses of Italian poets."

        "description": "Red as far as the eye can see and clear blue skies overhead. Welcome to Arches National Park, Utah in the United States. The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 44 metres and is 34 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches."

Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact."

If you have, there's a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

This unique subspecies of the grey wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

This village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described it as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image."

The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

        "description": "In the ghostly silence of Bodie in California, United States, it feels like time stands still. This once-booming gold rush town was established in 1860. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters.

The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.67 square kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the country. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat."

Tourism is at the heart of its economy, and it's no surprise that most of the buzz happens along its coastline, 125 kilometres of which is covered by beaches. Today's image features Coco Beach, a gem tucked away in Nerul, a village in the northern part of the state. Despite its calm vibes, there's plenty to do here. You can soak up the sun and dive into adventures like fishing, boating, dolphin spotting and swimming, all while immersing yourself in the local culture. But there's something that makes this beach even more special: its historical significance. It played an important role in the Goa Liberation Movement during the 1950s and 60s. It was one of the places where locals fought to end Portuguese rule and unite Goa with India. So, Coco isn't just another beach; it's a place with stories to tell, where history meets the sea."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi."

The leaves transition to vibrant gold, amber and crimson hues, offering a visual feast. The Ogilvie Mountains in Yukon, seen here today stand tall with their highest peak, Mount Frank Rae, reaching an elevation of more than 2,300 metres. This range was named after William Ogilvie, who was a Canadian Dominion land surveyor. Part of the Yukon Ranges, these mountains are crossed by the Dempster Highway, a route famed for its pristine views. Some of the picturesque peaks of Ogilvie Mountains are located within Tombstone Territorial Park. Wildlife, from moose to Canada lynx, roams the terrain in fall, searching for the last bounties of the season. Yukon's fall is a fleeting period, characterised by crisp air and autumn hues."

To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters of Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 4 metres long and weigh more than 1,200 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized."

The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun."

The origin of this holiday goes back to a 1995 joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers. During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, today be for all to enjoy. So, batten down the hatches, set sail and remember: on this day, everyone can be a pirate."

It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

Formed over a billion years, this natural wonder features sheer cliffs rising 100 metres above the canyon floor, stretching for over two kilometres. Designated as a provincial park in 1972, this landscape preserves a unique microenvironment, hosting arctic plant species typically found 1,000 kilometres to the north. In 2022 the park celebrated 50 years of conserving this unique slice of Canadian natural heritage. The two viewing platforms on the west side provide spectacular vistas of the canyon's depth and the verdant forest below. The park's incredible geology owes its existence to the last Ice Age, which left behind this awe-inspiring feature that continues to attract nature enthusiasts and photographers alike."

Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing. Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group."

Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."

Measuring up to 0.6 metres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 346 kilometres before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins.

        "description": "Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru. These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to six metres and weighing as much as 40 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

This national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, earning it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it's a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change, who have warned that glaciers might disappear by 2030. Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elk and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image. The park's ancient cedar forests and crystalline waterfalls capture the essence of the untamed wilderness, inviting all who seek peace and adventure within its bounds."

The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

The town's iconic four-kilometre-long boardwalk is lined with restaurants, shops and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches that stretch for 16 kilometres are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. With plenty of adventure and a heritage deeply rooted in history, Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."

These 'sea parrots' have a wingspan of 47 to 63 centimetres and travel vast distances to mate. Surprisingly, the colour of their beaks changes seasonally; during the breeding season, it is brighter with a hint of yellow and orange. However, in the nonbreeding season, the beak sheds its yellow highlight."

In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres."
