        "description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process."

        "description": "Wildlife roams freely in one of Chile's most stunning protected areas, where towering peaks and ancient glaciers shape the land. Established on this day in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia turns 66 years old today and covers over 448,000 acres. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,500 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today."

Just as the last sakura (cherry blossom) petals drift away, Tokyo's gardens start gearing up for their next big show: the iris bloom. Featured here is an iris garden in Tokyo. The iris is a flowering plant genus that has 310 recognised species, known for their bold and beautiful blossoms. The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows."

Established in 1886, Yoho National Park in British Columbia is known for its towering cliffs, glacial lakes and thunderous waterfalls. It's the second oldest national park in Canada and part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. Covering 1,313 square kilometres, the park is home to the Burgess Shale, a globally recognised fossil site. It consists of well-preserved marine life dating back over 500 million years—vital to understanding early evolution."

        "description": "A grand and gilded sight—the heart of the Minnesota State Capitol in the United States is waiting to be explored. Home to the Minnesota Senate, the House of Representatives, the governor's office and the attorney general's office, this building also houses a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court. Designed in the Beaux-Arts and American Renaissance styles, the Capitol integrates modern materials like iron, glass and steel. The term 'Beaux-Arts' was not used when the Capitol was built, but the style gained popularity, partly due to the architecture showcased at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition. Architect Cass Gilbert's design features a remarkable dome, which is inspired by St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City. Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world."

But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their colour-shifting skills, zippy tongues and wild adaptations. With over 200 species found in diverse habitats, these reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention."

        "description": "On May 8 each year, donkeys get their moment in the sun—though they'd probably prefer the shade. World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment."
