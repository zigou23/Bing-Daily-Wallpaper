        "description": "Blink and you miss it—until you hear it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the Ebro river, this Catalan village still offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport and even defence. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferryboats and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

        "description": "They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground and hold hands while they nap. Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild."

        "description": "Ever wanted to swim in the ocean without accidentally tasting half of it? Enter Mona Vale rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched between two beaches—The Basin beach and Mona Vale Beach—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a man-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is approximately 30 metres long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools were also used by large numbers of World War II troops who camped nearby. They are free, open year-round and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

        "description": "If you've ever looked at a tree and thought, 'That doesn't look like anything I've seen before,' you might have stumbled upon a baobab. These majestic giants are often referred to as the 'upside-down trees' because of their unusual appearance, with their wide, thick trunks resembling roots reaching for the sky. Native to Africa, Madagascar and parts of Australia, baobabs have earned their nickname due to their quirky silhouette, but there's much more to them than meets the eye."

        "description": "What began as an abandoned quarry over a century ago now transforms into a living colour wheel each spring. Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, tulips scent the air, colour lines the paths and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1912. Now spread across 55 acres (22 hectares), the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom."
