        "description": "Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honours these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science."

        "description": "Drive up Mount Hamilton in the Bay Area, California, United States, and immerse yourself in stunning views and rich history. The 19-mile Mount Hamilton Road is part of State Route 130. It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at 1,300 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day."

        "description": "This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 600-square-metre fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications."

        "description": "Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

        "description": "London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 13.5-tonne bell inside. It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans 6.9 metres, with the minute hands measuring 4.3 metres. At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament."

        "description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process."
