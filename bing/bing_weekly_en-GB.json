        "description": "With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring. The spring equinox occurs when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. Traditionally, spring is considered to begin on March 21. However, astronomers and calendar makers now agree that spring officially commences on March 20 across all time zones in North America. This event signals the true start of the season, bringing with it the beauty and symbolism of spring blooms."

        "description": "In the world of clever hunting, the black heron rules the roost. This bird thrives in shallow, open waters and at the edges of freshwater lakes and ponds. It's also commonly spotted in marshes, rice fields, seasonally flooded grasslands and along riverbanks. At first glance, this feathered genius seems like any other wading bird, with its long legs, slender neck and pointed beak that aid in hunting. But when it hunts, this jet-black African species showcases an extraordinary skill—it takes the shape of an umbrella, as seen in today's image."

        "description": "Sedona, Arizona, in the United States, is a place where nature, history and spirituality converge amidst stunning red rock formations. These fiery sandstone creations, part of the Schnebly Hill Formation, were shaped over millions of years during the Permian Period as sediment accumulated in an ancient sea. Over time, erosion has further sculpted Sedona's landscapes, which now glow brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. Notable formations such as Wilson Mountain, Seven Sacred Pools and Cathedral Rock offer iconic views."

        "description": "St Patrick's Day, celebrated on March 17, honours Ireland's patron saint and national apostle, Saint Patrick—a fifth-century missionary. A national holiday in Ireland, the festivity is marked by a range of cultural events, parades and traditional music and dance enjoyed across the globe. Interestingly, the first St Patrick's Day parade wasn't held in Ireland but in the United States. The earliest celebration was organised by Irish vicar Ricardo Artur in St Augustine, Florida, in 1601."

        "description": "As William Shakespeare wrote in his play 'Julius Caesar,' 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.' Today is the Ides of March, a day steeped in Roman history and tradition. The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life."

        "description": "Calculating the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is as easy as pi. Today is Pi Day, an event that celebrates this mathematical constant. This date was chosen because 3, 1 and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1,900 BCE."
