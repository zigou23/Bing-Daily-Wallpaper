        "description": "Imagine standing under a sky so dark that the Milky Way stretches across it like a luminous ribbon. This is the experience that International Dark Sky Week aims to bring back. Every April, during the week of the new moon (this year from April 21 to 27), we are invited to turn off our lights and gaze at the stars. The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student of Midlothian, Virginia, in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder."

        "description": "Happy Easter! Today is a special day for billions of Christians worldwide—a time of renewal, celebration and traditions. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny! Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today in various countries. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' would visit children and leave behind decorated eggs as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings. Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!"

        "description": "Imagine a world without the pyramids, the Great Wall or ancient cave cities—hard to picture, right? That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too. A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world."

        "description": "Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse."
