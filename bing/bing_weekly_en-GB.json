        "description": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognised by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies."

        "description": "Technicolour shopfronts, an elegant curve and a double-decker layout—this is Victoria Street in Edinburgh, Scotland. This street was built between 1829 and 1834 as part of a plan to modernise the city and improve access to Grassmarket from George IV Bridge. The architect, Thomas Hamilton, took one look at the steep hill and decided to lean into it—literally—designing a graceful curve that follows the natural contour of the land. He even added a terrace of arched shops on the upper level, creating a sort of two-tiered retail sandwich."

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control."

Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society."

This island has a coastline that stretches over 1,100 miles. While natural rivers are few, with Tirso being the longest, Sardinia has embraced innovation with 54 artificial lakes and dams. Among the most significant are Lake Omodeo and Lake Coghinas, key sources of water and electricity for the region."

Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for."
