        "description": "Two wheels, no fuel and a whole lot of purpose—cycling is affordable, eco-friendly and easy on the planet. Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for."

        "description": "When it comes to fast flyers with a flair for flowers, the skipper butterfly makes quite the landing. These pint-sized pollinators are easy to miss—until you spot one zipping through your garden as if it's late for an appointment. Catch one pausing on an Echinacea flower—like the one photographed at the Rockefeller State Park in New York, United States—and you've hit the jackpot. Skippers aren't your average butterflies. Technically part of the superfamily Papilionoidea, they're often mistaken for moths thanks to their stout bodies and erratic flight patterns. But unlike moths, they're active by day, have clubbed antennae with a hook at the end and wings they usually hold at quirky angles. Their name? It comes from their quick, darting flight."

        "description": "'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognise the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles and migrating humpback whales."

        "description": "Blink and you miss it—until you hear it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the Ebro river, this Catalan village still offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport and even defence. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferryboats and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

        "description": "They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground and hold hands while they nap. Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild."
