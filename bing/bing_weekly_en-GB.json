        "description": "Pollinator Week is in full bloom! This year's celebration takes place from June 16 to 22. It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen colour vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important."

        "description": "Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

        "description": "They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe and zero interest in your deadlines. Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognising these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection."

        "description": "Long before neckties and greeting cards, Father's Day began with a daughter's quiet act of remembrance and steadfast love. In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster in West Virginia, United States, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States. She sought to pay tribute to her father, an American Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads."

        "description": "When your head of state has a birthday, you don't throw a surprise party. You summon the Household Division, clear the Mall and get the Red Arrows to write a message in the sky. Trooping the Colour is a centuries-old military tradition, held each June to mark the official birthday of the reigning monarch—even if their actual birthday is in, say, November. The real reason? The weather's better. No one wants to troop anything through puddles. There's marching, music, horses, salutes—and a good chance of spotting a royal in a bearskin or bonnet."

        "description": "Not far from São Miguel Island in the Azores archipelago of Portugal, you'll find Vila Franca Islet. This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching."

        "description": "They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. The 801,163-acre (324,219-hectare) area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."
