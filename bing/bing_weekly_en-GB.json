        "description": "Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in Saxony, Germany? Dresden brings the story. The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt."

        "description": "Experience the magic of the summer solstice at Seljalandsfoss waterfall in Iceland. Today, the Northern Hemisphere celebrates the longest day of the year, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event. The 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic."

        "description": "Maasai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa. Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Maasai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. The Maasai giraffe is easily recognised by its jagged, irregular spots and inhabits various regions across eastern Africa. It is the largest giraffe species and the tallest land animal on Earth. Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is their long necks, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of their total height."

        "description": "The Five Towers rise majestically in the heart of the Dolomites in the province of Belluno in the Veneto region of Italy. They offer the perfect refuge from the summer heat and crowded beaches. Each tower has its own story to tell of ancient civilisations, adventurous hikers, daring climbers and distant battles. Shaped by time and weather, these Dolomite spires played a strategic role during the First World War, and it is still possible today to explore the trenches and remnants of that conflict-scarred past."

        "description": "Pollinator Week is in full bloom! This year's celebration takes place from June 16 to 22. It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen colour vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important."

        "description": "Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."
