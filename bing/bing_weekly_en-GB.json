        "description": "Today, we are in a wildlife-packed wonderland with rainforests older than the Amazon—Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani province, southern Thailand. Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. There are trails to tackle, kayaks to paddle and, if you're fortunate, you might even catch a glimpse of the massive (and stinky) Rafflesia flower when it's in bloom."

        "description": "Mardi Gras, or 'Fat Tuesday,' is a vibrant tradition that marks the last day of indulgence before the Christian season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins."

        "description": "A leek, a daffodil and a day to remember: Happy Saint David's Day! Today, Wales celebrates its patron saint and all things Welsh. Saint David was a 6th-century monk, bishop and preacher who played a key role in spreading Christianity across the country. He founded several religious communities known for their simple, disciplined lifestyles. One of his most famous sayings, 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain,' still resonates today as a reminder that small acts of kindness and faith matter. But why do people wear leeks and daffodils? Legend has it that the saint advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets to distinguish themselves from the enemy in battle against the Saxons. The daffodil, meanwhile, became popular later as a more visually appealing national emblem, especially during the 19th century."

Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead."
