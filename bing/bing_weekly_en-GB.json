        "description": "No need to hurry, because today marks the 25th anniversary of World Turtle Day. Turtles and tortoises thrive in a variety of environments and are linked to wisdom and perseverance. All tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. While turtles are smaller and built for swimming, tortoises are larger, heavier and adapted for life on land. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats."

        "description": "Every spring, a quiet town in Wales flings open its literary doors and lets the words pour in. Welcome to Hay-on-Wye, where sheep outnumber people, and books outnumber sheep. For over three decades, the Hay Festival has turned this border town into a buzzing hub of stories, ideas and page-turning excitement. What started in 1988 around a kitchen table and a shared love of books, has grown into one of the world's best-known literary gatherings. Held over 10 days in late May to early June, the festival draws writers, thinkers, poets, politicians, comedians, musicians and curious readers from every corner. Big names like Margaret Atwood, Stephen Fry and Martin Rees have all graced the stage."

        "description": "Legend says that it began with a single leaf drifting into a pot of boiling water in ancient China. Centuries later, tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world (after water). Today is International Tea Day, a global nod to this timeless beverage, established by the United Nations to recognise tea's role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. It's a day to honour both the drink and the people who are part of this industry."

        "description": "Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honours these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science."

The 19-mile Mount Hamilton Road is part of State Route 130. It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at 1,300 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day."

        "description": "This International Museum Day, let's immerse ourselves in Raoul Dufy's 600-square-metre fresco. The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications."

        "description": "Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."
