        "description": "Strolling through the streets of India during Holi is like stepping into a kaleidoscope of colours—vivid splashes of blue, green, red, yellow, pink and orange fill the air. This festival falls on the full moon day in the Hindu month of Phalguna—usually in late February or March. It is a significant tradition that symbolises the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. Outside India, Holi is celebrated by Hindus in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, as well as by Indian communities around the world, including in countries like the United Kingdom."

        "description": "If you're a lover of history with a dash of drama, the Château de Sully-sur-Loire, in the centre of northern France, has you covered. This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

        "description": "Let's be real—the beaches in Bali are beautiful, but the ones in Nusa Penida? That's a whole new vibe. This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honour today."

        "description": "In Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, some lions take napping to new heights—quite literally. The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image. Experts believe they climb to escape ground-level heat or pesky insects, but these naps make for an unforgettable sight. This vast park spans volcanic craters, open plains and dense forests. A safari here promises encounters with Uganda's incredible wildlife."

        "description": "London's skyline has had its fair share of famous landmarks, but none quite like The Shard. Rising 310 metres above England's capital, this glass-clad giant is not just the tallest building in the United Kingdom but also a symbol of modern London. It was designed by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect known for making a statement with high-tech, lightweight and functional designs. Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009, and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper."

        "description": "Today isn't just another day; it's a statement. Happy International Women's Day, everyone! It's a global celebration of resilience, rights and remarkable women. First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate."
