        "description": "On May 4, Star Wars fans celebrate Star Wars Day, a tribute to the beloved franchise created by George Lucas. The film series consists of nine instalments, collectively referred to as the 'Skywalker Saga.' One of the memorable filming locations is Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today's image. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929."

        "description": "In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 40 centimetres tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands."

        "description": "Today, while the world celebrates May Day with parades and protests, Hawaii takes a more fragrant approach—by draping itself in flowers. On May 1, Hawaii, United States, celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root."

        "description": "It's time to jazz up—literally. From the smoky clubs of London to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. In the United Kingdom, jazz flourished in the 1940s, with London's Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, founded in 1959, becoming a legendary venue. British jazz icons like Tubby Hayes and Courtney Pine pushed the genre forward, while the EFG London Jazz Festival remains a major event, drawing international stars and local talent alike."

        "description": "The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat."
