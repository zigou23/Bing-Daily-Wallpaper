        "description": "They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. The 801,163-acre (324,219-hectare) area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

        "description": "In Lüderitz, Namibia, these birds aren't just passing through—they're standing their ground. Literally. On one leg. These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering up to 150 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot."

        "description": "Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water? Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres (607,000 hectares). It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognised as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance."

        "description": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognised by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies."

        "description": "Technicolour shopfronts, an elegant curve and a double-decker layout—this is Victoria Street in Edinburgh, Scotland. This street was built between 1829 and 1834 as part of a plan to modernise the city and improve access to Grassmarket from George IV Bridge. The architect, Thomas Hamilton, took one look at the steep hill and decided to lean into it—literally—designing a graceful curve that follows the natural contour of the land. He even added a terrace of arched shops on the upper level, creating a sort of two-tiered retail sandwich."

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control."
