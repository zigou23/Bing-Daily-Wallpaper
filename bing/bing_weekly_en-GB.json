        "description": "Every spring, Washington, DC, in the United States, transforms into a sea of pink and white as the cherry blossoms bloom, marking the return of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. This beloved event commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the United States, symbolising the enduring friendship between the two nations. This year's festival is running through April 13, with peak bloom expected to last four to seven days, depending on the weather. The Tidal Basin is the most popular spot for viewing, offering breathtaking scenes near landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial."

        "description": "Welcome to Saguaro National Park in Arizona, United States. Today's image features a rainbow over Wasson Peak, which is the tallest point in the Tucson Mountains at more than 1,400 metres. Hikers can reach the summit via trails like King Canyon, Hugh Norris or Sweetwater, all winding through towering saguaros, prickly pear cacti and desert wildflowers. At the top of the park, the Tucson Basin, Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains stretch into the horizon, making the climb worth every step. Named after John Wasson, a 19th-century American journalist, the peak also holds traces of the Hohokam people and Arizona's mining past, including the Gould Mine. Whether you're here for the views, history, or challenge, Wasson Peak is a true desert adventure—just don't underestimate the Arizona sun!"

        "description": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a penny—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms."

        "description": "For one Sunday in March, the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries take a break from the usual hustle to honour mums with flowers, cards and the occasional burnt toast in bed. Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration."

        "description": "It's not every day you see a desert burst into colour, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent."

        "description": "Watch closely; you might catch a glimpse of the black-naped monarch. This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy."
