        "description": "Today's image features a frog. Frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a penny—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms."

Welcome to Ostuni, in the Apulia region of Italy. Apulia is a southeastern area of the country, located in the 'heel of Italy's boot.' It has the longest coastline of any mainland region in the country and is home to numerous attractions, including beaches, cliffs and charming cities like the one we see in today's image."

        "description": "For one Sunday in March, the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries take a break from the usual hustle to honour mums with flowers, cards and the occasional burnt toast in bed. Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration."

        "description": "It's not every day you see a desert burst into colour, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent."

        "description": "Watch closely; you might catch a glimpse of the black-naped monarch. This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy."

Since 1961, this annual event by the International Theatre Institute (ITI) has united audiences and artists in a shared appreciation of storytelling, creativity and culture. Every year, a renowned theatre figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. These messages highlight theatre's role in society—be it as a mirror to reality, an agent of change, or a refuge for the imagination. From Shakespeare's soliloquies to experimental avant-garde productions, theatre has continuously evolved while holding onto its core: human connection."

But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. Hence, the last Wednesday of March is dedicated to them—Manatee Appreciation Day."

A time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves and one particularly famous ring. But why this date? March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. This day was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore JRR Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favourite moments and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?"
