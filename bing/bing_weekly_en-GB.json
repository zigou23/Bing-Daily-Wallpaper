        "description": "Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

        "description": "London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 13.5-tonne bell inside. It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans 6.9 metres, with the minute hands measuring 4.3 metres. At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament."

        "description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process."

        "description": "Wildlife roams freely in one of Chile's most stunning protected areas, where towering peaks and ancient glaciers shape the land. Established on this day in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia turns 66 years old today and covers over 448,000 acres. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,500 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today."

Just as the last sakura (cherry blossom) petals drift away, Tokyo's gardens start gearing up for their next big show: the iris bloom. Featured here is an iris garden in Tokyo. The iris is a flowering plant genus that has 310 recognised species, known for their bold and beautiful blossoms. The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows."

Established in 1886, Yoho National Park in British Columbia is known for its towering cliffs, glacial lakes and thunderous waterfalls. It's the second oldest national park in Canada and part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. Covering 1,313 square kilometres, the park is home to the Burgess Shale, a globally recognised fossil site. It consists of well-preserved marine life dating back over 500 million years—vital to understanding early evolution."
