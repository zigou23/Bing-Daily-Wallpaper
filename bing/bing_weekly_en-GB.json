        "description": "Welcome to the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff Bay's cultural powerhouse, where musical theatre, opera, dance and comedy thrive under one iconic roof. Opened in 2004, the centre makes a bold statement with its iconic inscription, 'In These Stones Horizons Sing,' etched across the front in both Welsh and English. Designed by Jonathan Adams, the building's architecture mirrors Wales' landscapes. While the façade features multi-coloured layers inspired by slate quarries, forests, mountains and sea cliffs, the hull-shaped copper-hued roof gives a nod to the maritime history of Tiger Bay."

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky."

One of Bhutan's annual religious festivals, which are known as tshechus, it is a vibrant showcase of Vajrayana Buddhist heritage. The celebration begins on the 10th day of the second lunar month, which typically falls in March or April. This year, the festival kicks off today and concludes on April 12."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate International Beaver Day! Established in 2009 by Beavers Wetlands & Wildlife, this day highlights the vital role beavers play in our ecosystems. Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to a metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers."

        "description": "Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen."

Millions watch, and cheer, making it a national tradition. With every race comes the chance for a new underdog story or a champion's rise. So, who will clear the final fence first this year?

This beloved event commemorates the 1912 gift of 3,000 cherry trees from Tokyo's Mayor Yukio Ozaki to the United States, symbolising the enduring friendship between the two nations. This year's festival is running through April 13, with peak bloom expected to last four to seven days, depending on the weather. The Tidal Basin is the most popular spot for viewing, offering breathtaking scenes near landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial."
