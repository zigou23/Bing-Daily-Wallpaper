        "description": "It's not every day you see a desert burst into colours, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona, United States, when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent."

This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects midair."

        "description": "Today's image features Odeon of Herodes Atticus, located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. This stone Roman theatre has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia. Built in 161 CE by the wealthy Roman Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, this ancient venue has hosted everything from classical tragedies to modern-day concerts.  Almost after 100 years, the structure was destroyed by the Heruli, leaving it in ruins for many years. Restoration began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it wasn't until the 1950s that the city fully reconstructed it. It was reopened in 1955 as the prime location for the Athens and Epidaurus Festival. From captivating ballets to ancient Greek tragedies, it's an unforgettable venue where history meets the present."

These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats."

These small birds are widespread across Europe, North Africa and parts of Asia, favouring open woodlands, orchards and gardens. Their pointed beaks are perfect for extracting seeds from teasels and thistles, though they also eat insects during the breeding season."

        "description": "Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes."

        "description": "Pictured here is the awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, United States—a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer. Anvil crawlers—often called rocket lightning—are tree-like lightning discharges that move horizontally. Their slower speed makes them one of the few types of lightning that the human eye can easily follow. These lightning bolts usually form high up in the sky, far above the ground—which is why they don't create loud thunder.  Nebraska's unique geography, with its Great Plains, makes it a hotspot for such phenomena."
