With over 100 species spread across the globe, kingfishers are found in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to coastal regions. Most species, like the common kingfisher, prefer freshwater environments across Europe, Asia and Africa, while others, such as the belted kingfisher, are found in North and South America. These birds are instantly recognisable by their vibrant plumage, often featuring a striking mix of blues, greens and oranges."

        "description": "The Temple of Saturn, standing in the heart of ancient Rome, holds centuries of stories within its weathered ruins. Traditionally believed to have been dedicated in 497 BCE, this temple honoured Saturn, the god of agriculture and wealth. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, with ancient historians offering conflicting accounts. The temple saw multiple reconstructions over time, including a significant rebuilding by Munatius Plancus in 42 BCE and another in the late 4th century after a devastating fire."

        "description": "The Dolmen of Sorginetxe stands tall amidst the rolling Basque hills in Alava, Spain, inviting you to step back into a time long before the region's bustling modern-day life. Sorginetxe is a Basque term meaning 'house of Sorgin' or 'house of witches.' Dating back to 3,000 BCE, this ancient burial site was crafted by the early Basque inhabitants and provides a glimpse into their spiritual practices. The dolmen consists of massive stones arranged in a formation that was used for burial purposes, and possibly, ceremonies. Over time, this megalith has withstood centuries of weathering and still serves as a powerful reminder of the past."

The majestic and imposing mountains stand as silent guardians, while the lakes, with their clear and calm waters, reflect the blue sky and the surrounding peaks."

        "description": "If you're a lover of history with a dash of drama, the Château de Sully-sur-Loire, in the centre of northern France, has you covered. This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

        "description": "Let's be real—the beaches in Bali are beautiful, but the ones in Nusa Penida? That's a whole new vibe. This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honour today."
