        "description": "Featured in today's image is one of the largest waterfall systems in the world—Iguazu Falls—located on the border between Argentina and Brazil, within the Iguazu River. Spanning approximately 3 kilometres in width, the tallest waterfalls reach up to 82 metres. The falls consist of around 275 individual waterfalls—each one different, yet all equally mesmerising. One of the most iconic features of the falls is the Devil's Throat canyon, which is almost 90 metres wide and nearly 80 metres deep. The name 'Iguazu' is derived from the Guarani or Tupi words 'y,' meaning water, and 'ûasú,' means big. Here, every drop of water, every trail and every encounter tells a story of beauty, strength and connection."

        "description": "The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

        "description": "Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 500,000 hectares. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat."

The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California, United States, are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 110 metres high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods."

Designated in 1987, it safeguards a landscape of towering limestone cliffs, hidden caves, dense forests and untouched shorelines. As part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, it's a haven for species that have adapted to its rugged terrain, like black bears, massasauga rattlesnakes and white-tailed deer."

        "description": "Cute, clumsy and completely captivating, penguins always steal the show. Among the many remarkable species of penguins are the Magellanic penguins, featured in today's image. A species native to South America's coastal regions, these birds breed along Patagonia's shores in Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands. Named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, these medium-sized penguins were first documented in 1520. They can grow up to 76 centimetres tall and weigh around 6 kilograms. Skilled hunters, they thrive on a diet of small fish, squid and krill, efficiently filtering seawater with their specialised salt-excreting glands. With the abundant marine life along South America's Atlantic coast, they have a reliable food source. While these flightless creatures may not soar in the skies, they certainly capture hearts."

Stretching over 271,100 hectares, this landscape features towering fjords, winding river valleys and alpine landscapes. More than half of its terrain is blanketed in ice, with glaciers dominating 51% of its area. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons."
