        "description": "Saguaro National Park, a stunning desert known for its hot summers and mild winters, is in Arizona, United States. The park is famous for its giant saguaro cacti, which can grow over 12 metres tall. It is also a home to a variety of wildlife, including coyotes, javelinas, bobcats and numerous bird species. Spanning more than 37,000 hectares, the park is divided into two areas: the Rincon Mountain District to the east and the Tucson Mountain District to the west. Featured in today's image is a rainbow over Wasson Peak, the highest point of the Tucson Mountain District, standing at 1,429 metres. Against a backdrop of desert cacti and rocky slopes, the vibrant arc stands out in a place where rain is scarce, proving that even the driest landscapes can surprise you."

        "description": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands in Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

        "description": "Let's be honest, frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms."

Welcome to Ostuni, in the Apulia region of Italy. Apulia is a southeastern area of the country, located in the 'heel of Italy's boot.' It has the longest coastline of any mainland region in the country and is home to numerous attractions, including beaches, cliffs and charming cities like the one we see in today's image."

        "description": "Today's image features a spot in Sydney, Australia, where shimmery waters meet famous landmarks: Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour. On the right, we see a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 134 metres summit for breathtaking panoramic views."

        "description": "It's not every day you see a desert burst into colours, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona, United States, when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent."

This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects midair."
