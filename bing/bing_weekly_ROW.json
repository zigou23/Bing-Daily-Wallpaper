        "description": "Yoho sounds like something you'd shout from a mountaintop—and honestly, you might find yourself doing just that. Established in 1886, Yoho National Park in British Columbia is known for its towering cliffs, glacial lakes and thunderous waterfalls. It's the second oldest national park in Canada and part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. Covering 131,300 hectares, the park is home to the Burgess Shale, a globally recognised fossil site. It consists of well-preserved marine life dating back over 500 million years—vital to understanding early evolution. Here, one can observe elk, mountain goat, marmot and the occasional grizzly bear in their natural habitat. Lodgepole pines dominate the forest canopy, while avalanche lilies appear shortly after snowmelt."

        "description": "Plaza de España in Seville, Spain, as seen in today's image, is one of the unforgettable filming locations from the Star Wars films. This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929."

Spanning over 31,000 hectares, the park boasts more than 2,000 natural arches. From the iconic Delicate Arch standing proudly against the skyline to the expansive Landscape Arch and the majestic Double Arch, each rock formation tells a story shaped by millions of years of erosion, weathering and natural rock fractures. Other highlights include Balanced Rock, Three Penguins and countless other formations that make every visit unforgettable."

        "description": "In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 40 centimetres tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands."

        "description": "Today's image features nature's own vibrant confetti—plumeria flowers, often grown in tropical regions, mostly in Hawaii, United States. This species has no nectar, yet it tricks moths and butterflies with its irresistible scent—a mix of citrus, jasmine, gardenia, coconut, peach, vanilla and woody undertones. These flowers come in a variety of colours, including pink, red, white, yellow, orange or pastel. As captivating as they are, their milky sap is toxic, so handle with care!"

        "description": "Featured in today's image is one of the largest waterfall systems in the world—Iguazu Falls—located on the border between Argentina and Brazil, within the Iguazu River. Spanning approximately 3 kilometres in width, the tallest waterfalls reach up to 82 metres. The falls consist of around 275 individual waterfalls—each one different, yet all equally mesmerising. One of the most iconic features of the falls is the Devil's Throat canyon, which is almost 90 metres wide and nearly 80 metres deep. The name 'Iguazu' is derived from the Guarani or Tupi words 'y,' meaning water, and 'ûasú,' means big. Here, every drop of water, every trail and every encounter tells a story of beauty, strength and connection."

        "description": "The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."
