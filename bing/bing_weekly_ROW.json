        "description": "Kenai Fjords National Park, featured in today's image, is a gem on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula in the United States. Stretching over 271,100 hectares, this landscape features towering fjords, winding river valleys and alpine landscapes. More than half of its terrain is blanketed in ice, with glaciers dominating 51% of its area. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons."

        "description": "Did you know that the first beach chairs were developed in the 19th century to protect against the fine sand and wind? Beach chairs have a special charm even in stormy weather, as in the picture today in front of the pier on Steinwarder in Heiligenhafen, Germany. Steinwarder, a picturesque peninsula, was originally only connected to the mainland by salt marshes and the Eichholz lowlands. Today, it is a paradise for vacationers seeking peace and nature."

        "description": "Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, featured in today's image is one of nature's most stunning displays of geothermal power. The largest hot spring in the United States, it spans 110 metres across and reaches temperatures of 70 °C. This geothermal marvel is fuelled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters."

        "description": "Today's image features a desert icon—the Joshua tree—native to the Mojave Desert in the southwestern United States. This remarkable tree grows rapidly during its first ten years, averaging about 7 centimetres per year. After that, its growth slows down to around 4 centimetres per year and over its lifespan, it can reach up to 15 metres. Their long, messy and rough appearance resembles the look of a beard, adding to the tree's unique and rugged charm."

        "description": "Yellow warbler—featured in today's image—is a tiny songbird that brightens the landscape with its vibrant colour. Hopping from branch to branch, it spends its days feasting on insects like caterpillars and beetles. These birds thrive in wetlands, woodlands and gardens, making their homes in shrubs and small trees. During the breeding season, males turn into tireless singers, hoping to win a mate with their sweet tunes. When it's time to nest, females carefully weave small cup-shaped homes from grass, plant fibres and feathers, ensuring a cosy spot for their eggs. But here's something impressive—yellow warblers won't tolerate freeloaders. If a brown-headed cowbird sneaks an egg into their nest, these clever birds simply build a new layer over it, protecting their own offspring. As summer ends, they embark on a journey south to Central and South America, spending the colder months basking in warmer climates before returning."

The park's unique geography is adorned with stunning sandstone cliffs and narrow slot canyons, covering 600 square kilometres. This national park has a diverse plant and animal life, including nearly 300 bird species and 19 species of bats. Back in 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument to protect its stunning landscape. A decade later, in 1919, United State Congress added more land to it and it was then renamed as Zion National Park. With its rich history and breathtaking scenery, it is a must-visit destination, offering something magical for everyone."

Spanning nearly 100 square kilometres, this UNESCO World Heritage site is famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. Among these unique formations is the enchanting Love Valley, known for its distinctive rock formations and stunning views. The park's rich history is equally captivating. For centuries, people have been carving homes, churches and even entire underground cities into the soft rock formations. These ancient dwellings, some dating back to the 4th century, served as places of refuge, especially for early Christians who sought protection from invaders. Göreme is a must-visit destination that offers something for everyone—whether you're a history enthusiast, an adventure seeker or simply someone looking to enjoy the serene beauty of this magical place."
