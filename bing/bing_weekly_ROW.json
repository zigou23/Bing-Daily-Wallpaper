        "description": "Featured in today's image is the Seljalandsfoss waterfall. Located along Iceland's South Coast, the 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsá River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic."

        "description": "Stretching over 560 kilometres along Brazil's southern Atlantic, Santa Catarina's coast is a place shaped by history and change. Long before European ships appeared on the horizon, the Carijós—skilled fishermen and farmers of the Tupi-Guarani group—lived here. By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry. Fishing communities and ports flourished throughout the 19th and 20th centuries."

        "description": "Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly is known for its vivid colouration and powerful flight, making it a frequent visitor to both urban gardens and wild habitats. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important. The Asian swallowtail uses sophisticated colour vision and colour constancy to identify flowers, especially those in the citrus family, even under changing light conditions. This remarkable ability allows it to remain an effective pollinator across a wide range of environments. Delicate yet determined, the Asian swallowtail reminds us that even the smallest pollinators play a big role in keeping nature balanced and beautiful."

        "description": "Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

        "description": "They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe and zero interest in your deadlines. Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. There are seven species of sea turtles: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Among them, the leatherback sea turtle is the largest, sometimes reaching almost 2 metres in length and weighing between 300 to 640 kilograms. Each species has unique behaviours, diets and nesting patterns—yet all share a deep connection to coastal and marine environments. Let's protect these ancient mariners—for the oceans, and for the future."

Native to open grasslands and shrublands of South America, the lesser rhea is a large, flightless bird. Known for its impressive speed and agility on land, it can reach speeds of up to 60 kmph. It is sometimes referred to as the South American ostrich, as it closely resembles a small ostrich."

        "description": "Cinque Torri, or Five Towers, rise majestically in the heart of the Dolomites in the province of Belluno, within the Veneto region of Italy. They offer the perfect refuge from the summer heat and crowded beaches. Each tower has its own story to tell: of ancient civilisations, adventurous hikers, daring climbers and distant battles. Shaped by time and weather, these Dolomite spires played a strategic role during World War I, and it is still possible to explore the trenches and remnants of that conflict-scarred past. However, nature is stronger than history."
