        "description": "Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 1 metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment."

        "description": "London's skyline has had its fair share of famous landmarks, but none quite like The Shard. Rising 310 metres above England's capital, this glass-clad giant is not just the tallest building in the United Kingdom but also a symbol of modern London. It was designed by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect known for making a statement with high-tech, lightweight and functional designs. Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009 and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper."

        "description": "Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones', where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen."

        "description": "Saguaro National Park, a stunning desert known for its hot summers and mild winters, is in Arizona, United States. The park is famous for its giant saguaro cacti, which can grow over 12 metres tall. It is also a home to a variety of wildlife, including coyotes, javelinas, bobcats and numerous bird species. Spanning more than 37,000 hectares, the park is divided into two areas: the Rincon Mountain District to the east and the Tucson Mountain District to the west. Featured in today's image is a rainbow over Wasson Peak, the highest point of the Tucson Mountain District, standing at 1,429 metres. Against a backdrop of desert cacti and rocky slopes, the vibrant arc stands out in a place where rain is scarce, proving that even the driest landscapes can surprise you."

        "description": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands in Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."
