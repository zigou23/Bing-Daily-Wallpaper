        "description": "If you think a coastline is just a line where land meets sea, the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park is here to change your mind. This UNESCO World Heritage Site along Germany's North Sea coast is a place where the tides redraw the landscape twice a day. When the tide retreats, it exposes vast mudflats, creating an ever-changing terrain that's home to an incredible ecosystem. With an area of 4,410 square kilometres, it is also the largest national park in Germany. It's a paradise for migratory birds like oystercatchers and red knots, seals and tiny creatures that thrive in the shifting sands. One of the best ways to experience the park is mudflat hiking. Guided tours let you walk across the seabed, squishing through the soft ground while learning about the creatures beneath your feet."

        "description": "Plum blossoms, a muse for countless artists and writers, bloom as symbols of endurance and elegance. Native to China, the tree has also been introduced to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Found in China's iconic spots like Nanjing's Plum Blossom Mountain, Wuhan's East Lake and Hangzhou's West Lake, these fleeting blooms attract visitors eager to witness their ephemeral magic. In Chinese culture, these blossoms represent purity and the arrival of spring, whereas in Japan, they symbolise new beginnings. The plum blossom's resilience, flowering even in harsh winter conditions, makes it a powerful symbol of endurance and hope. With over 300 varieties, this tree can thrive in gardens of all sizes, offering a variety of shapes and colours. Beyond their visual appeal, plum blossoms are also used to flavour traditional cuisine, such as floral teas and tangy preserved plums. So, why not take the chance to branch out and experience them for yourself?"

        "description": "Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense headbutting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."

Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. There are trails to tackle, kayaks to paddle and if you're fortunate, you might even catch a glimpse of the massive (and stinky) Rafflesia flower when it's in bloom."

Originally known Place d'Armes and later Plaza de Armas under Spanish rule, it served a key site for military parades and public executions in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, the former military plaza was renamed Jackson Square in honour of Andrew Jackson, the hero of the battle and the seventh president of the United States."

        "description": "Today's image features the southern yellow-billed hornbill, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. This medium-sized bird measures about 48 to 50 centimetres in length with a wingspan of 60 centimetres and weighs 150 to 200 grams. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. They nest in natural tree cavities, with the female sealing herself inside using a mud wall, leaving only a small slit through which the male feeds her and the chicks. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah."

Known for its dramatic cliffs, dense rainforests and cascading waterfalls, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects. Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley."
