        "description": "Jotunheimen National Park in Norway is a prime example of protected natural landscapes. Established in 1980, it covers over 114,000 hectares of mountains, glaciers and deep valleys. It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at 2,469 metres. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. Flowing through the park, the Gjende lake is famous for its striking green colour, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 18 kilometres in length and around a kilometre at its widest point, the lake sits at around 1,000 metres above sea level. It's the launch point for the famous Besseggen hike—which attracts thousands each year—made famous by Henrik Ibsen's play 'Peer Gynt.'"

        "description": "Here we see a fascinating Amazonian phenomenon—a Julia butterfly on the nose of a yellow-spotted river turtle in Ecuador's Amazon River region. Butterflies in the Amazon are known to sip the tears of turtles, which provide a vital source of sodium, a mineral in short supply. The yellow-spotted river turtle is one of the largest river turtles in South America. While these turtles are well-adapted to the waters, they face a range of threats from humans, birds, snakes, large fish, frogs and mammals. In the 1960s, they were heavily exploited for the American pet trade, leading to strict regulations on their importation. Today, a captive, self-sustaining population exists in the United States, with some living over 30 years in captivity."

Also known as giant baobabs, they are the largest and most famous of Madagascar's baobab species. With their root-like branches stretching toward the sky, baobabs have an almost otherworldly presence."

        "description": "Legend says that it began with a single leaf drifting into a pot of boiling water in ancient China. Centuries later, tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world (after water). Tea harvesting is a delicate craft, rooted in tradition and influenced by geography. From the misty hills of Zhejiang province in China, pictured here, to the rolling estates of Assam in India, the process differs. Green tea leaves are sun-dried or steamed to preserve their freshness, while oolong and black teas undergo oxidation to develop complex, bold flavours."

        "description": "Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. Unfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever."

It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at 1,300 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day."

        "description": "As the sun sets over the Garonne River, Toulouse reveals one of its most beautiful panoramas: the Saint-Pierre Bridge and the majestic Dôme de la Grave reflected in the water. This bridge, connecting the two banks of the Ville Rose, was built in 1849, then rebuilt in 1927 and 1987 to adapt to modern needs. Opposite it, the Dôme de la Grave, crowning the former hospital of the same name, dominates the landscape. This 19th-century architectural masterpiece is a symbol of Toulouse, visible from afar thanks to its imposing silhouette. Once dedicated to the sick and the poor, the Hôpital de la Grave bears witness to the city's medical past, and today it remains a centre of research and innovation."
