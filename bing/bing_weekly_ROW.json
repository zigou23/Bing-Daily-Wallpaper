        "description": "If you're a lover of history with a dash of drama, the Château de Sully-sur-Loire, in the centre of northern France, has you covered. This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

        "description": "Let's be real—the beaches in Bali are beautiful, but the ones in Nusa Penida? That's a whole new vibe. This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honour today."

        "description": "In Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, some lions take napping to new heights—quite literally. The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image. Experts believe they climb to escape ground-level heat or pesky insects, but these naps make for an unforgettable sight. This vast park spans volcanic craters, open plains and dense forests. A safari here promises encounters with Uganda's incredible wildlife. Lions, hold a special place in human history, frequently appearing in sculptures, paintings, national flags, literature and films. The Asiatic lion used to roam large areas from Saudi Arabia and eastern Turkey to Iran, Mesopotamia and across the Indian subcontinent, stretching from the Indus River to Bengal and Central India's Narmada River. However, since the early 20th century, its habitat has been confined to Gujarat's Gir National Park and surrounding areas."

For over 500 years, this Renaissance masterpiece has been keeping time in Piazza San Marco, offering both locals and tourists a spectacle of moving figures, astronomical precision and a bit of Venetian charm. The massive blue and gold clock face displays hours, minutes, moon phases and zodiac signs."

        "description": "If you think a coastline is just a line where land meets sea, the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park is here to change your mind. This UNESCO World Heritage Site along Germany's North Sea coast is a place where the tides redraw the landscape twice a day. When the tide retreats, it exposes vast mudflats, creating an ever-changing terrain that's home to an incredible ecosystem. With an area of 4,410 square kilometres, it is also the largest national park in Germany. It's a paradise for migratory birds like oystercatchers and red knots, seals and tiny creatures that thrive in the shifting sands. One of the best ways to experience the park is mudflat hiking. Guided tours let you walk across the seabed, squishing through the soft ground while learning about the creatures beneath your feet."

        "description": "Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense headbutting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."
