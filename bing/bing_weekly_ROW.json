        "description": "A breathtaking maze of sandstone formations and awe-inspiring views awaits you at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, United States. People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote. The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth."

        "description": "Nearly 100 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,000 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. Mount Fuji is one of Japan's cherished 'Three Holy Mountains' along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. In 2013, it was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, highlighting its cultural importance."

        "description": "Today we are at the Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson's idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 192-metre-tall structure that has become the symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the title of the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, epics composed as poems and set in the ancient Hindu kingdoms of India. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva,' the Hindu god. It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats mountain range."

        "description": "Throughout history, red deer have captured humanity's awe and respect. These creatures can be found across Europe, Asia, parts of North Africa and a few other regions. The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength."

        "description": "The European river otter, pictured here, is more than just an adorable face in the wild. Found across Europe, Asia and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. These semi-aquatic animals are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."
