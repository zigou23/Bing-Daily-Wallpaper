        "description": "Pictured here is the awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, United States—a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer. Anvil crawlers—often called rocket lightning—are tree-like lightning discharges that move horizontally. Their slower speed makes them one of the few types of lightning that the human eye can easily follow. These lightning bolts usually form high up in the sky, far above the ground—which is why they don't create loud thunder.  Nebraska's unique geography, with its Great Plains, makes it a hotspot for such phenomena."

        "description": "One of nature's most mesmerising freshwater wonders, Cenote Nicte Ha in Tulum, Mexico, is featured in today's image. A cenote is a natural sinkhole that arises from the collapse of limestone bedrock, exposing groundwater. Named after the Mayan words for flower 'Nicte' and water 'Ha', this open cenote is known for its crystal-clear turquoise waters and beautiful water lilies. Sunlight filters through its open surface, supporting vibrant aquatic life. For the ancient Maya, cenotes were sacred portals to the underworld and vital water sources in the Yucatán Peninsula. With a maximum depth of approximately 10 metres, Cenote Nicte Ha remains a popular spot for snorkelling and diving, offering a glimpse into an ancient and fragile ecosystem. Freshwater is not only essential to life—it's life!"

        "description": "One of the most breathtaking places to observe the richness of forests is the Danum Valley Conservation Area in Sabah on the Malaysian island of Borneo, as seen in today's image. This approximately 43,800-hectare sanctuary is home to an ancient, 130-million-year-old rainforest, teeming with rare species like Bornean orangutans, clouded leopards and over 270 bird species. In addition to its incredible biodiversity, the Danum Valley is also a haven for researchers, with long-term studies monitoring its ecosystem and wildlife to aid conservation efforts. Let's take a moment to appreciate nature's beauty and support efforts to safeguard our forests for generations to come."

These blooms typically come in shades of white and yellow, though garden varieties can also display hues of orange or pink, with petals and coronas that may either match or contrast beautifully. Known since ancient times for their botanical and medicinal properties, narcissi were officially classified by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum (1753). They naturally thrive in meadows and woodlands across southern Europe and North Africa, with their greatest variety found in the Western Mediterranean, particularly on the Iberian Peninsula."

        "description": "Sedona, Arizona, is a place where nature, history and spirituality converge amidst stunning red rock formations. These fiery sandstone creations, part of the Schnebly Hill Formation, were shaped over millions of years during the Permian Period as sediment accumulated in an ancient sea. Over time, erosion has further sculpted Sedona's landscapes, which now glow brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. Notable formations such as Wilson Mountain, Seven Sacred Pools and Cathedral Rock offer iconic views."
