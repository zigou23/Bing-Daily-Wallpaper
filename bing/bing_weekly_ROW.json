        "description": "Nestled in the heart of eastern Utah in the United States is Arches National Park—featured in today's image— a surreal landscape of red rock formations and natural stone arches. Spanning over 31,000 hectares, the park boasts more than 2,000 natural arches. From the iconic Delicate Arch standing proudly against the skyline to the expansive Landscape Arch and the majestic Double Arch, each rock formation tells a story shaped by millions of years of erosion, weathering and natural rock fractures. Other highlights include Balanced Rock, Three Penguins and countless other formations that make every visit unforgettable."

        "description": "In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 40 centimetres tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands."

        "description": "Today's image features nature's own vibrant confetti—plumeria flowers, often grown in tropical regions, mostly in Hawaii, United States. This species has no nectar, yet it tricks moths and butterflies with its irresistible scent—a mix of citrus, jasmine, gardenia, coconut, peach, vanilla and woody undertones. These flowers come in a variety of colours, including pink, red, white, yellow, orange or pastel. As captivating as they are, their milky sap is toxic, so handle with care!"

        "description": "Featured in today's image is one of the largest waterfall systems in the world—Iguazu Falls—located on the border between Argentina and Brazil, within the Iguazu River. Spanning approximately 3 kilometres in width, the tallest waterfalls reach up to 82 metres. The falls consist of around 275 individual waterfalls—each one different, yet all equally mesmerising. One of the most iconic features of the falls is the Devil's Throat canyon, which is almost 90 metres wide and nearly 80 metres deep. The name 'Iguazu' is derived from the Guarani or Tupi words 'y,' meaning water, and 'ûasú,' means big. Here, every drop of water, every trail and every encounter tells a story of beauty, strength and connection."

        "description": "The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

        "description": "Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 500,000 hectares. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat."

The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California, United States, are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 110 metres high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods."
