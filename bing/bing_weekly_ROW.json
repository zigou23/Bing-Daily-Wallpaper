        "description": "Honey bees may be small, but without them, your grocery list would be a lot shorter. No more berries, avocados or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. Unfortunately, bee populations are in danger. Pesticide exposure, habitat loss and climate change are driving their numbers down, threatening both global food security and biodiversity. The good news is that small actions can make a big difference. Support local beekeepers, plant pollinator-friendly flowers and avoid chemical pesticides. And the next time you stir honey into your tea, remember the tiny worker behind that golden spoonful and why protecting this buzzing species matters more than ever."

        "description": "Drive up Mount Hamilton in the Bay Area, California, and immerse yourself in stunning views and rich history. The 31-kilometre Mount Hamilton Road is part of State Route 130. It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at 1,300 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day."

        "description": "As the sun sets over the Garonne River, Toulouse reveals one of its most beautiful panoramas: the Saint-Pierre Bridge and the majestic Dôme de la Grave reflected in the water. This bridge, connecting the two banks of the Ville Rose, was built in 1849, then rebuilt in 1927 and 1987 to adapt to modern needs. Opposite it, the Dôme de la Grave, crowning the former hospital of the same name, dominates the landscape. This 19th-century architectural masterpiece is a symbol of Toulouse, visible from afar thanks to its imposing silhouette. Once dedicated to the sick and the poor, the Hôpital de la Grave bears witness to the city's medical past, and today it remains a centre of research and innovation."

        "description": "Pictured here is a spectacular view of a delta in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy. Spanning over 54,900 hectares, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes and is one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

        "description": "The stunning bird, featured in today's image, is the great green macaw. Measuring around 90 centimetres in length and weighing above 1 kilogram, it is the second-heaviest macaw species and the third-heaviest parrot species in the world. This macaw species is known for its mostly green plumage, with a bold reddish forehead and soft pale blue hues on its lower back, rump and upper tail feathers. They have incredibly powerful beaks, practically built like nature’s nutcracker, which helps them open even the toughest nuts. Native to the tropical forests of Central and South America, this colourful parrot is critically endangered, with fewer than 1,000 individuals estimated in the wild. These intelligent, social birds depend heavily on old-growth forests, particularly in places like Costa Rica, where they nest in almendro trees."

        "description": "London's most famous clock tower isn't called Big Ben—that name belongs to the massive 13.5-ton bell inside. It has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honour Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans nearly 7 metres, with the minute hands measuring approximately 4 metres. At 96 metres tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament."

        "description": "Most ports rely on docks and cranes that extend into the shoreline. Porto Flavia in the Sulcis-Iglesiente region, however, took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process."
