        "description": "Blink and you miss it—until you hear it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, United States. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the Ebro River, this Catalan village still offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport and even defence. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferryboats and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

        "description": "They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground and hold hands while they nap. Otters are nature's playful pranksters. They belong to the Mustelidae family, a diverse group that includes weasels, badgers and minks and are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems."

        "description": "Today's photo takes us to one of Germany's most beautiful cities—Heidelberg, a city where rich history and innovative modernity blend with a romantic past. Picturesquely situated on the Neckar river, Heidelberg attracts visitors from all over the world. High above the Old Town, on the northern slope of the Königstuhl, and surrounded by verdant forests, stands the majestic Heidelberg Castle. It is considered one of Germany's most famous ruins. Once the magnificent residence of the Electors Palatine, it was destroyed by wars and lightning strikes in the 17th century."

Located, just west of the city centre, this district has long been the go-to spot for scenic walks and historic temples. The river winds gently beneath the wooden Togetsukyō Bridge, originally built during the Heian era (794 to 1185) and rebuilt in 1934. Further in, you'll find Tenryū-ji, once the residence of shoguns and now a peaceful Zen temple."

        "description": "What began as an abandoned quarry over a century ago now transforms into a living colour wheel each spring. Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, tulips scent the air, colour lines the paths and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1912. Now spread across 22 hectares, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom."
