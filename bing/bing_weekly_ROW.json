        "description": "Nestled in a picturesque pond landscape just a few kilometres from Dresden, Germany, Moritzburg Castle stands proudly, as seen in today's image. Originally built in the 16th century as a hunting lodge for Maurice, Elector of Saxony, it was transformed into a country seat surrounded by a moat in the 18th century under Augustus the Strong. Today, it impresses visitors with its Baroque architecture and idyllic location on an artificial island. Majestic towers and halls, furnished with precious furniture and trophies, bear witness to the former splendour of the Saxon court. It is no wonder that this castle is not only the landmark of the town of the same name but is also regarded as one of the most beautiful Baroque castles in Germany."

        "description": "Pictured here is a skipper butterfly, known for its quick, darting flight, resting on a vibrant Echinacea, or coneflower, at Rockefeller State Park in New York, United States. Native to North America, Echinacea is loved by both gardeners and pollinators for its hardy blooms. Its name comes from the Greek word 'ekhinos,' meaning 'hedgehog,' referring to its spiky centre. These flowers bloom during summer, providing long-lasting colour and attracting bees, butterflies and hummingbirds. They are also appreciated for their low-maintenance nature and ability to naturalize. Unfortunately, wild Echinacea populations are under growing threat from excessive harvesting. In addition, habitat loss and environmental changes caused by human activity also threaten the long-term survival of some species."

        "description": "Blink and you miss it—until you hear it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, United States. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the Ebro River, this Catalan village still offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport and even defence. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferryboats and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."
