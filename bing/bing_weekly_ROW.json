        "description": "Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly is known for its vivid colouration and powerful flight, making it a frequent visitor to both urban gardens and wild habitats. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important. The Asian swallowtail uses sophisticated colour vision and colour constancy to identify flowers, especially those in the citrus family, even under changing light conditions. This remarkable ability allows it to remain an effective pollinator across a wide range of environments. Delicate yet determined, the Asian swallowtail reminds us that even the smallest pollinators play a big role in keeping nature balanced and beautiful."

        "description": "Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

        "description": "They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe and zero interest in your deadlines. Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. There are seven species of sea turtles: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Among them, the leatherback sea turtle is the largest, sometimes reaching almost 2 metres in length and weighing between 300 to 640 kilograms. Each species has unique behaviours, diets and nesting patterns—yet all share a deep connection to coastal and marine environments. Let's protect these ancient mariners—for the oceans, and for the future."

Native to open grasslands and shrublands of South America, the lesser rhea is a large, flightless bird. Known for its impressive speed and agility on land, it can reach speeds of up to 60 kmph. It is sometimes referred to as the South American ostrich, as it closely resembles a small ostrich."

        "description": "Cinque Torri, or Five Towers, rise majestically in the heart of the Dolomites in the province of Belluno, within the Veneto region of Italy. They offer the perfect refuge from the summer heat and crowded beaches. Each tower has its own story to tell: of ancient civilisations, adventurous hikers, daring climbers and distant battles. Shaped by time and weather, these Dolomite spires played a strategic role during World War I, and it is still possible to explore the trenches and remnants of that conflict-scarred past. However, nature is stronger than history."

This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site and even a lookout for whale-watching."

        "description": "They say everything's bigger in Texas, United States—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Spread over more than 320,000 hectares and originally part of Mexico, it became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a national park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."
