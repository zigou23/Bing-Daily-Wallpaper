        "description": "Let's be honest, frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms."

Welcome to Ostuni, in the Apulia region of Italy. Apulia is a southeastern area of the country, located in the 'heel of Italy's boot.' It has the longest coastline of any mainland region in the country and is home to numerous attractions, including beaches, cliffs and charming cities like the one we see in today's image."

        "description": "Today's image features a spot in Sydney, Australia, where shimmery waters meet famous landmarks: Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour. On the right, we see a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 134 metres summit for breathtaking panoramic views."

        "description": "It's not every day you see a desert burst into colours, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona, United States, when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent."

This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects midair."

        "description": "Today's image features Odeon of Herodes Atticus, located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. This stone Roman theatre has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia. Built in 161 CE by the wealthy Roman Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, this ancient venue has hosted everything from classical tragedies to modern-day concerts.  Almost after 100 years, the structure was destroyed by the Heruli, leaving it in ruins for many years. Restoration began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it wasn't until the 1950s that the city fully reconstructed it. It was reopened in 1955 as the prime location for the Athens and Epidaurus Festival. From captivating ballets to ancient Greek tragedies, it's an unforgettable venue where history meets the present."

These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats."
