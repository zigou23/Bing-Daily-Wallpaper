        "description": "Yellow warbler—featured in today's image—is a tiny songbird that brightens the landscape with its vibrant colour. Hopping from branch to branch, it spends its days feasting on insects like caterpillars and beetles. These birds thrive in wetlands, woodlands and gardens, making their homes in shrubs and small trees. During the breeding season, males turn into tireless singers, hoping to win a mate with their sweet tunes. When it's time to nest, females carefully weave small cup-shaped homes from grass, plant fibres and feathers, ensuring a cosy spot for their eggs. But here's something impressive—yellow warblers won't tolerate freeloaders. If a brown-headed cowbird sneaks an egg into their nest, these clever birds simply build a new layer over it, protecting their own offspring. As summer ends, they embark on a journey south to Central and South America, spending the colder months basking in warmer climates before returning."

        "description": "Zion National Park—seen in today's image—is Utah's first national park. The park's unique geography is adorned with stunning sandstone cliffs and narrow slot canyons, covering 600 square kilometres. This national park has a diverse plant and animal life, including nearly 300 bird species and 19 species of bats. Back in 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument to protect its stunning landscape. A decade later, in 1919, United State Congress added more land to it and it was then renamed as Zion National Park. With its rich history and breathtaking scenery, it is a must-visit destination, offering something magical for everyone."

        "description": "Nestled in the heart of Cappadocia, Türkiye, Göreme Historical National Park is a fascinating fusion of history, adventure and natural beauty. Spanning nearly 100 square kilometres, this UNESCO World Heritage site is famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. Among these unique formations is the enchanting Love Valley, known for its distinctive rock formations and stunning views. The park's rich history is equally captivating. For centuries, people have been carving homes, churches and even entire underground cities into the soft rock formations. These ancient dwellings, some dating back to the 4th century, served as places of refuge, especially for early Christians who sought protection from invaders. Göreme is a must-visit destination that offers something for everyone—whether you're a history enthusiast, an adventure seeker or simply someone looking to enjoy the serene beauty of this magical place."

With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too."

        "description": "Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse. It is a place of awe and solitude, where visitors can hike beneath the soaring bridges, gaze at some of the darkest night skies in the country and step back into a landscape sculpted over millions of years."

        "description": "In the region of Guadix, between mountains and valleys, stands La Calahorra, a small town with a monumental treasure, its imposing Renaissance castle. This architectural gem, built in the 16th century by the first Marquis of Zenete, combines military strength with the elegance of Italian palaces and is one of the earliest examples of the Renaissance in Spain. Perched at an altitude of 1,250 metres, the castle dominates the landscape of the Marquisate of Zenete and has been the scene of key historical events, from the Christian conquest to the Alpujarras Rebellion. Recently, it gained prominence after being chosen as the location for the series 'House of the Dragon,' created by Ryan Condal and George R.R. Martin."

        "description": "Atlantic spotted dolphins—the stars of today's image—are known for the spots on their body, which multiply and become denser with age. When younger, they lack spots, often resembling slender bottlenose dolphins. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. They're fast swimmers, known for their playful bow-riding and acrobatic, shallow leaps. These dolphins are amazing team players when it comes to hunting, as they often hunt in groups, working together to surround their prey, which includes small fish, benthic invertebrates and even squid. Interestingly, they prefer to hunt at night, making the most of the cover of darkness to catch their prey. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch."
