        "description": "The blue shark, featured here, is sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only member of its genus that prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. While typically a laid-back swimmer, it's capable of sudden bursts of speed when needed. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions. They give birth to live young and are known for their large litters—ranging from 25 to over 100 pups. After birth, the young head to special nursery zones, far from adult habitats, where they can grow and learn the ways of the sea."

        "description": "Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons. Though Iceland is full of volcanic marvels, formations like these are rare, making this quiet cove truly remarkable."

        "description": "There's something about the way animals move through the grasslands of the Maasai Mara, bathed in golden rays, that makes you pause and simply watch. This stretch of savanna in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image."

        "description": "Featured in today's image is Tokyo—the dynamic capital of Japan—where tradition meets innovation. Formerly known as Edo, it was just a modest fishing village. It gained political prominence in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the largest cities in the world, with over a million residents. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. The city's skyline is defined by iconic skyscrapers such as the soaring Tokyo Skytree and the striking Metropolitan Government Building, while historic treasures like Senso-ji Temple, Meiji Shrine and the Imperial Palace Gardens provide a captivating window into Japan's rich cultural heritage."

Nestled in the Atlantic Ocean, just southeast of Florida and northeast of Cuba, the Bahamas is famous for its beautiful waters, white sandy beaches and vibrant coral reefs. Every corner of the Bahamas is a shade card of blue, but the most captivating of all are the turquoise waters that surround the islands. The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkelling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, the sea glows with a brilliance that feels almost magical."

On 19 September 1925, the Prince of Wales—later the Duke of Windsor—laid the foundation stone for the present-day terminus during his official visit to Argentina. This marked the beginning of a major transformation, with the station rebuilt to include fourteen roofed platforms, modern buffer stops and a vast main concourse—one of the largest railway halls in the world at the time. Today, Constitución is a busy gateway for all southbound trains on the Roca Line, connecting Buenos Aires to cities like La Plata, Mar del Plata and Bahía Blanca."

Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 139,000 hectares and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,800 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys."
