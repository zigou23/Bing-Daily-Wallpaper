        "description": "Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even in total darkness. And like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past."

        "description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama."

        "description": "Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars."

Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions."

The name of their genus, helianthus, comes from the Greek words for sun (helios) and flower (anthos). These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centres that are the most common."
