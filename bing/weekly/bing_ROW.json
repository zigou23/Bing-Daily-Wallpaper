        "description": "Tilting, a village on Fogo Island at Canada's eastern edge, was settled by Irish immigrants in the 18th century. It remains a unique example of an Irish outport community that has preserved its cultural identity. The bright fishing sheds and homes weren't painted just for aesthetics; the hues once made buildings easier to spot during heavy fog or snowfall. These vivid colours also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here. It is also one of the few places in North America where traditional Irish communal land use practices—such as shared meadows and garden plots—have been preserved in both form and function."

        "description": "Wolfe Creek Crater in Western Australia, pictured here, was created by a meteorite estimated to have weighed over 14,000 tonnes. Known as Kandimalal to the Jaru people, it was officially identified in 1947, though Indigenous knowledge long preceded that. The crater is about 875 metres in diameter and sits within Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater National Park, a remote protected area. Almost perfectly circular, it's among the world's largest craters. The park's flat plains and desert grasslands make the crater's rim especially visible."

It is also popularly known as the Spice Island for its exceptional production of mace, nutmeg, pepper and cloves. Nutmeg was once one of the world's most sought-after commodities—and this tiny island in Indonesia's Banda Islands played a key role in its global trade. It once sparked global rivalries and deadly sea battles, influencing the geopolitical boundaries of the modern world."

        "description": "In the centre of Mannheim's magnificent Friedrichsplatz—one of the most beautiful Art Nouveau squares in Europe—rises the imposing water tower, pictured here. But it is far more than just a functional structure; it is the city's iconic landmark. The tower was designed by Gustav Halmhuber, a German architect who later also worked on the Berlin Reichstag. Built between 1886 and 1889, the 60-metre-high tower once served as the city's drinking water supply and held an impressive two million litres of water. Today, it is a popular tourist destination and event location, representing Mannheim's successful combination of tradition and modernity. The surrounding park invites you to take relaxing strolls, attend cultural events or indulge in romantic moments."

        "description": "Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around. The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia."

        "description": "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide."

        "description": "Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, is a hill crowned by the 14th-century St Michael's Church Tower—a Grade I listed building. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore. Sometimes, when the air and ground temperatures are just right, the Tor looks like it's floating above the mist—a trick of the light called a Fata Morgana. The name comes from Morgan le Fay, a sorceress in Arthurian legends. The Tor stands in the heart of the Summerland Meadows, which are part of the Somerset Levels. It rises to an elevation of 158 metres and is clearly visible from far away, making it a striking landmark. Although often described as an island, the Tor actually sits at the western tip of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the River Brue."
