        "description": "Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes. With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. The Dolomites themselves—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—rise dramatically behind the village, their pale limestone faces glowing pink at sunset in a phenomenon locals call 'enrosadira.'"

        "description": "Featured in today's image are among the most iconic big cats in the animal kingdom—the lions—known for their powerful roar which can be heard from 8 kilometres. One of the best places to witness lions in the wild is Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. Nestled in the heart of East Africa, this vast savannah is home to around 850 to 900 lions. The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts. But Maasai Mara is more than a wildlife haven; it's a model for community-led conservation. Local Maasai communities work alongside conservationists to protect both lions and their ancestral lands, showing that coexistence is not only possible but powerful."

        "description": "Amid the fast-paced traffic of Manaus, in Amazonas, Brazil, there's a point where meaning dissolves. Seen from above, the image appears to show a roundabout like any other. But in its centre rests an unusual sculpture: gigantic steel letters intertwined in a knot. Created by artist Sérgio Cardoso in 2003, the work arrived before the roundabout itself—traffic circled around it before any road planning. Made of stainless steel and about 4 metres tall, its original name, 'Diálogo,' never stuck. For residents, it was always 'Bola das Letras.' And so, it remained: a spontaneous nickname, a reference that slipped out of control and became part of the urban landscape. Today, few remember the official title—or even the name of the roundabout."

The sheer presence of this natural wonder is overwhelming as it straddles the border between Argentina and Brazil. This vast waterfall system stretches nearly 3 kilometres and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist."

        "description": "Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even in total darkness. And like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past."

        "description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama."

        "description": "Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars."
