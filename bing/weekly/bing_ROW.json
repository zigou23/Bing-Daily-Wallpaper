        "description": "There's something about the way animals move through the grasslands of the Maasai Mara, bathed in golden rays, that makes you pause and simply watch. This stretch of savanna in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image."

        "description": "Featured in today's image is Tokyo—the dynamic capital of Japan—where tradition meets innovation. Formerly known as Edo, it was just a modest fishing village. It gained political prominence in 1603, when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the largest cities in the world, with over a million residents. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. The city's skyline is defined by iconic skyscrapers such as the soaring Tokyo Skytree and the striking Metropolitan Government Building, while historic treasures like Senso-ji Temple, Meiji Shrine and the Imperial Palace Gardens provide a captivating window into Japan's rich cultural heritage."

        "description": "The Bahamas is an archipelagic island country comprising more than 3,000 islands, cays and islets. Nestled in the Atlantic Ocean, just southeast of Florida and northeast of Cuba, the Bahamas is famous for its beautiful waters, white sandy beaches and vibrant coral reefs. Every corner of the Bahamas is a shade card of blue, but the most captivating of all are the turquoise waters that surround the islands. The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkelling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, the sea glows with a brilliance that feels almost magical."

On 19 September 1925, the Prince of Wales—later the Duke of Windsor—laid the foundation stone for the present-day terminus during his official visit to Argentina. This marked the beginning of a major transformation, with the station rebuilt to include fourteen roofed platforms, modern buffer stops and a vast main concourse—one of the largest railway halls in the world at the time. Today, Constitución is a busy gateway for all southbound trains on the Roca Line, connecting Buenos Aires to cities like La Plata, Mar del Plata and Bahía Blanca."

Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 139,000 hectares and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,800 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys."

It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

        "description": "The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities."
