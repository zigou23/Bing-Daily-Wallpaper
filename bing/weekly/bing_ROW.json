        "description": "Constitución railway station in Buenos Aires, pictured here, is a historic hub that reflects Argentina's drive for growth, connectivity and the spirit of unity that emerged during a transformative era. On 19 September 1925, the Prince of Wales—later the Duke of Windsor—laid the foundation stone for the present-day terminus during his official visit to Argentina. This marked the beginning of a major transformation, with the station rebuilt to include fourteen roofed platforms, modern buffer stops and a vast main concourse—one of the largest railway halls in the world at the time. Today, Constitución is a busy gateway for all southbound trains on the Roca Line, connecting Buenos Aires to cities like La Plata, Mar del Plata and Bahía Blanca."

        "description": "Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 139,000 hectares and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,800 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys."

        "description": "Graceful, powerful and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

        "description": "The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities."

Nestled in the Ain department, the Cize-Bolozon Viaduct—featured in today's image—has accomplished this feat for over 70 years. Built in 1950 to replace a structure destroyed during World War II, it has watched over the valley with understated elegance ever since."

This beach is known for its limestone cliffs, where nature has carved out caves that open directly onto the sea. Orosei, a town of about 7,000 residents in the Baronie region, is nestled in the Cedrino Valley just 2.5 kilometres from the sea. Its economy thrives on agriculture, marble quarrying and tourism. This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park."

This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the crystal-clear Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from an almost 200,000-hectare area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River."
