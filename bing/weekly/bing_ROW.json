        "description": "Presidents' Day is observed on the third Monday of February and is officially recognized at the federal level as Washington's Birthday. The holiday was originally celebrated on February 22, George Washington's birthday, before being rescheduled under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. Passed in 1968 and implemented in 1971, the Act shifted several federal holidays to Mondays, creating standardized long weekends. Washington's Birthday was among those affected, which moved the observance away from Washington's actual birthday and allowed its meaning to broaden over time.",

The day gained wider recognition after the International Whaling Commission's 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, which marked a major milestone in international whale conservation.",

Few symbols capture this emotion as naturally as the bleeding heart flower, pictured here. With its unmistakable heart-shaped blooms, the plant emerges each spring, growing up to 2 feet tall and spreading nearly 30 inches wide, creating a graceful, almost poetic display."

That shift explains why cross-border links like the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge connecting Laos and Thailand matter. Bridges come in many forms, each built to meet a specific challenge. Arch bridges manage compression, suspension bridges span long distances, and concrete box-girder bridges prioritize stability and load efficiency. This bridge uses the box-girder design, making it a practical choice for crossing the wide, fast-moving Mekong River.",

Charles Darwin's observations connected variation, the survival of individuals best suited to their environment, and inheritance in ways science still builds on. His legacy rests on years of studying variation—finches, fossils, barnacles—and recognizing patterns others had overlooked. When 'On the Origin of Species' was published in 1859, it offered a framework explaining how species evolve through natural selection.",

Spanning more than 3.4 million acres across California and Nevada, it is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Across this vast expanse, salt flats, volcanic hills, sweeping sand dunes, and distant snowcapped peaks create a landscape shaped by time and extremes. From the soaring heights of Telescope Peak, which rises over 11,000 feet above the desert floor, to the depths of Badwater Basin, 282 feet below sea level, the park is a study in contrasts.",

Part of a protected nature reserve, these dramatic rock formations are admired for their ecological value and visual impact. Es Vedrà rises around 1,300 feet straight from the sea, its sheer limestone cliffs resembling a mountain range. Nearby, the jagged outline of Es Vedranell has earned it the nickname 'sleeping dragon,' appearing to guard its larger sibling.",
