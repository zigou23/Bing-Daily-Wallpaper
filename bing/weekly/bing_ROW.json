        "description": "Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, is a hill crowned by the 14th-century St Michael's Church Tower—a Grade I listed building. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore. Sometimes, when the air and ground temperatures are just right, the Tor looks like it's floating above the mist—a trick of the light called a Fata Morgana. The name comes from Morgan le Fay, a sorceress in Arthurian legends. The Tor stands in the heart of the Summerland Meadows, which are part of the Somerset Levels. It rises to an elevation of 158 metres and is clearly visible from far away, making it a striking landmark. Although often described as an island, the Tor actually sits at the western tip of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the River Brue."

        "description": "This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece. What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971."

        "description": "Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in Saxony, Germany? Dresden brings the story. The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of the Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt."

        "description": "The Amazon Rainforest spreads across much of the Amazon basin in South America. One notable region is in Ecuador. Although smaller than Brazil's share, it's considered one of the most biologically dense areas on Earth. It also shelters an extraordinary range of life—jaguars, macaws, black caimans, electric eels and medicinal plants, many of which are still unknown to science."

Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Masai giraffes were named after Herr von Tippelskirch, a member of a German scientific expedition who was the first to collect information and specimens of this giraffe subspecies and bring them to Europe."

Located along Iceland's South Coast, the 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsá River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic."

        "description": "Stretching over 560 kilometres along Brazil's southern Atlantic, Santa Catarina's coast is a place shaped by history and change. Long before European ships appeared on the horizon, the Carijós—skilled fishermen and farmers of the Tupi-Guarani group—lived here. By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry. Fishing communities and ports flourished throughout the 19th and 20th centuries."
