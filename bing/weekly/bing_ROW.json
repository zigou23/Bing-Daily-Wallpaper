        "description": "Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 139,000 hectares and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,800 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys."

        "description": "Graceful, powerful and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

        "description": "The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities."

        "description": "Imagine a bridge that connects more than just two sides of a river. Nestled in the Ain department, the Cize-Bolozon Viaduct—featured in today's image—has accomplished this feat for over 70 years. Built in 1950 to replace a structure destroyed during World War II, it has watched over the valley with understated elegance ever since."

        "description": "We are in Cala Luna, a jewel in the crown of the Gulf of Orosei in eastern Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This beach is known for its limestone cliffs, where nature has carved out caves that open directly onto the sea. Orosei, a town of about 7,000 residents in the Baronie region, is nestled in the Cedrino Valley just 2.5 kilometres from the sea. Its economy thrives on agriculture, marble quarrying and tourism. This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park."

        "description": "Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida in the United States is Rainbow Springs State Park. This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the crystal-clear Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from an almost 200,000-hectare area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River."

        "description": "That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, also known as the maroon clownfish and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone."
