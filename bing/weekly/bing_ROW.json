        "description": "Staghorn coral—pictured here—is a branching, stony coral that plays a vital role in shaping marine ecosystems. It can be easily recognised by its thick, upright branches that can grow more than 2 metres tall. These strong, round branches look a lot like a stag's antlers, which is why it's called Staghorn coral. Scientifically named Acropora cervicornis, it is among the fastest-growing corals on Earth—serving as a central hub of biodiversity in the Western Atlantic."

        "description": "Glowing like a silent guardian in the night sky, the moon is the fifth-largest satellite in the solar system and orbits Earth at an average distance of approximately 384,399 kilometres. With a diameter of about 3,474 kilometres—roughly one-quarter that of Earth—it exerts only one-sixth of our planet's gravity. This is why astronauts famously bounce when they walk on its surface. The moon's surface is mostly covered with rock and fine lunar dust, created by billions of years of impacts from meteoroids and micrometeorites. This powdery material, called regolith, gives the moon its grey, dusty appearance."

Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings, white body and moon-like eyespots—can be found across North America.  Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators."

        "description": "Today's image takes us to Santa Catarina in Brazil. This is a reforestation area where beauty and functionality share the same space. Tall, aligned and fast-growing, these trees are not native to the country — they came from Oceania, but took root here in the early 20th century. Eucalyptus is now one of the most planted species in the country, the basis for the production of paper, cellulose and charcoal. When well-managed, especially in already degraded areas, it can relieve pressure on native forests and favour soil recovery. However, in large areas, the continuous cultivation of eucalyptus can alter the local environment, affecting biodiversity and water dynamics."

From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 580 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 78,000 hectares, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation."

        "description": "The Temple of Philae, often called the Temple of Isis, is one of Egypt's most enchanting ancient sites. Originally built on Philae Island, it was moved to nearby Agilkia Island to save it from flooding. The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past."

        "description": "Featured in today's image is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze with shooting stars. These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands."
