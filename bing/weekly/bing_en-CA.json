        "description": "Just outside Arches National Park in Utah, United States, lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing photographers, nature lovers and hikers. Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After a 2.4-kilometre walk, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons."

        "description": "Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild. Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times."

        "description": "Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes. With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. The Dolomites themselves—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—rise dramatically behind the village, their pale limestone faces glowing pink at sunset in a phenomenon locals call 'enrosadira.'"

The sheer presence of this natural wonder is overwhelming as it straddles the border between Argentina and Brazil. This vast waterfall system stretches nearly three kilometres and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist."

        "description": "They may resemble ancient statues, but the monoliths of the Mingan Archipelago weren't carved by human hands. These limestone formations began taking shape over 450 million years ago by the power of sea spray, waves and wind. The result? Towering stone pillars that now rise along Quebec's coastline, standing firm as the tide continues its slow work. The surrounding tide pools come alive at low tide, revealing starfish, sea urchins and other marine life. The Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, where these formations are found, is a quiet haven for wildlife established in 1984. The area is a seasonal stop for Atlantic puffins, which arrive between late May and August to breed and raise their chicks on the cliffs and grassy spaces. The park is also known for its seabird colonies, seal sightings and plant life adapted to harsh coastal conditions. It's a landscape that quietly speaks of time, tide and resilience."
