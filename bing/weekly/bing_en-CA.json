        "description": "When the twinkling reflections on Italy's Lake Como outshine the stars, you know Christmas has docked in Domaso. Once a fishing village, this lakeside town now transforms each winter into a glittering display of holiday cheer, where pastel houses, old churches and waterfront villas are wrapped in ribbons of light. The result? A picturesque Christmas scene."

        "description": "In December, the forests of Alsace, in France's Grand Est region, wrap themselves in a veil of fog, as if nature were holding its breath before winter. Amid Scots pines and silver firs, the moss-covered ground muffles every step and the silence feels almost sacred. These woodlands, which cover nearly 40% of Alsace, shelter a rich biodiversity: roe deer, wild boar, black woodpeckers and sometimes the elusive lynx, which has returned after decades of absence."

        "description": "On Florida's southern tip lies one of the United States' most unusual landscapes. The Everglades is not a typical swamp or river. It is a slow, shallow sheet of water that drifts south across flat grasslands toward Florida Bay, linking forests, marshes, mangroves and coastal prairies. This subtropical wilderness supports hundreds of species, including alligators, manatees and the endangered Florida panther. In 1947, the United States established the Everglades National Park, protecting over 6,100 square kilometres and shifting conservation toward preserving entire ecosystems rather than isolated landmarks."

        "description": "In a quiet valley of western Honduras lie the ruins of Copán—a city of the ancient Maya civilisation. Its sky served as both compass and calendar, guiding celestial events and shaping temples, rituals and the rhythm of life. Around 426 CE, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', a warrior from the Maya heartland, founded Copán and established its royal dynasty. The city became a centre of Maya art, astronomy and power."

        "description": "High atop a termite mound in the Maasai Mara National Reserve—a protected savanna in southwestern Kenya—a cheetah scans the plains. Its sleek body can reach speeds of over 120 km/h, making it the fastest land mammal on Earth. Long legs and a flexible spine allow incredible acceleration, while its strong tail helps maintain balance during high-speed chases. Today is International Cheetah Day—an event that couldn't have arrived any quicker. With fewer than 7,100 individuals left in the wild, these are among Africa's most vulnerable big cats."

        "description": "Every December, as morning unfolds, a chorus of rattling calls fills the marshes of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. This more than 230-square-kilometre sanctuary in central New Mexico, United States, prepares to stage one of nature's most stirring performances as sandhill cranes return from their seasonal journey. Soon, tens of thousands of snow geese and other migratory birds join the scene, filling the sky with movement and sound."

        "description": "What's your winter personality: cosy wanderer or slope-chaser? Whistler, in British Columbia, lets you try both in the same day. This resort municipality sits about 125 kilometres north of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains, with two main ski peaks: Whistler and Blackcomb. These are linked by the PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola, famous for giving a suspended, panoramic valley view in just a few minutes of travel. The area gained fame when it co-hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, and some of those venues are still open to the public today. The name 'Whistler' comes from the high-pitched call of the local hoary marmots that were once common around the slopes."
