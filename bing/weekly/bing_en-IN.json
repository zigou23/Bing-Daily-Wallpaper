        "description": "Italy's Dolomites don't just tower; they enchant, turning every trail into a story. Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 1,200 square kilometres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 2,500 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys. Amid the dramatic landscape of the Dolomites lies one of its most spectacular peaks, Seceda, featured in today's image. With a height of over 2,000 metres, it offers the highest panoramic viewpoint in Val Gardena, a scenic valley in the province of South Tyrol."

        "description": "Graceful, powerful and impossible to miss—the northern gannet is the largest seabird on the waters of the North Atlantic. It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

        "description": "The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, California, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities. Death Valley National Park, spanning more than 12,000 square kilometres, is the largest national park in the contiguous United States."

        "description": "We are in Cala Luna, a jewel in the crown of the Gulf of Orosei in eastern Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This beach is known for its limestone cliffs, where nature has carved out caves that open directly onto the sea. Orosei, a town of about 7,000 residents in the Baronie region, is nestled in the Cedrino Valley just 2.5 kilometres from the sea. Its economy thrives on agriculture, marble quarrying and tourism. This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 kilometres, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights. Every May, the town celebrates the festivals of Sant'Isidoro and Santa Maria 'e Mare with traditional processions. During the festivities, the local flavours shine—especially in seadas, a special dessert sprinkled with golden strawberry-tree honey."

This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the crystal-clear Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a more than 1,800-square-kilometre area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River."

        "description": "That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection."
