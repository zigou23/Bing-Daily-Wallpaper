        "description": "Few cities carry their past vividly as Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh. Towering over its skyline, Gwalior Fort is a 6th-century hilltop stronghold. Nicknamed 'the Gibraltar of India,' this fort was praised by Mughal emperor Babur as the 'pearl among the fortresses of Hind' for its strength and grandeur. The fort has witnessed rulers from the Tomars and the Mughals to the Scindias, each leaving echoes of their reign, and remains tied to tales of battles, royal intrigue and whispered treasures."

        "description": "Look closely at this ammonite fossil. Its swirling shell, once home to a prehistoric sea creature, holds a mathematical secret—a spiral pattern. Each new chamber is proportionally larger than the previous one, maintaining a consistent growth ratio, often associated with the Fibonacci sequence."

        "description": "There are big statues—and then there's the Leshan Giant Buddha. Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At approximately 70 metres tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 28 metres wide, its ears measure nearly 7 metres long and each foot extends over 8 metres. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries."

        "description": "In Ezhikkara, water decides how life unfolds. The village lies north of Kochi in Kerala's Ernakulam district, within the backwaters of the Periyar basin. Canals cut through low-lying land, linking its fields and neighbourhoods to wider waterways. Boats often serve where roads stop and many homes stand close to the water, their walls stained by years of monsoon rain and salt."

With whiskered snouts and round bodies, manatees are calm marine mammals that spend their days grazing on seagrass, a surprisingly delicate existence for such large creatures."

        "description": "Step closer, and the details begin to speak—every stone, spire and statue seems to hold a story of its own. Conceived in the late 19th century, the Hungarian Parliament Building was designed to reflect a nation's ambition, blending Gothic Revival elegance with distinctly Hungarian motifs. Architect Imre Steindl's vision took shape over two decades through the work of more than 1,000 craftsmen. Even the central dome, rising 96 metres high, carries meaning: the height honours the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol."

        "description": "Each autumn, the quiet waterways of Oregon, United States, become seasonal waypoints for hooded mergansers—small diving ducks native to North America. They are agile divers, plunging beneath the surface to catch fish and other prey. Males, known as drakes, stand out with their fan-shaped white crests, dark heads and chestnut-brown sides, while females, called hens, are brownish grey with smaller crests. Oregon's lakes and wetlands provide sheltered feeding grounds as these birds migrate or winter across the continent."
