        "description": "Not every science lesson requires a classroom. In La Jolla, California, United States, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars."

        "description": "Silent hunters of the night sky, owls are among the most intriguing creatures in the animal kingdom. Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honours their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face."

        "description": "Bright and bold, sunflowers are loved by bees, birds and just about everyone. The name of their genus, helianthus, comes from the Greek words for sun (helios) and flower (anthos). These annual plants are known for their large, daisy-like flowers and radiant charm. While sunflowers come in shades of red, orange and maroon, it's the classic yellow blooms with brown centres that are the most common. Beyond their good looks, sunflowers are grown for their tasty seeds, which are snacked on, pressed for cooking oil or offered as a treat for birds."

        "description": "There's something timeless about Capitol Reef National Park in Utah, United States—a place where red rock cliffs, winding canyons and ancient stories come together under the desert sky. Long before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations and celestial events."

        "description": "Every August, Edinburgh stops being just a city and starts acting up—literally. From pub basements to park benches, stages appear in the strangest places and shows pop up on quiet streets. Welcome to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, or the Fringe. The story began in 1947, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born."

Kalalau Beach, at the end of Kauai's Kalalau Trail, is where tired feet meet a sandy reward. The only land access is the trail itself, a rugged trek through valleys and along coastal cliffs. During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay."

        "description": "Picture yourself stepping into a red sandstone giant that clings to the Yamuna's banks—a world where Mughal majesty unfolds in every arch and courtyard. Spanning less than half a square kilometre in a semi-circular embrace, Agra Fort is a sprawling storybook of Mughal brilliance. It was here in 1530 that Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned, setting the stage for a dynasty that would shape Indian history, architecture and politics. Years later, Akbar began its grand transformation in 1565, and by 1573, the fort had taken on the form we see today. Walk past mammoth gates and into a world where Islamic, Persian and Hindu architecture blend seamlessly in every arch, dome and courtyard. From the public court of Diwan-e-Aam to the elegance of Diwan-e-Khas, from the Musamman Burj to intricately designed palaces and gardens, every corner speaks of power and poetic artistry. A walk here is a time-travel ticket into an empire of red walls, royal whispers and artistic opulence. Ready to step in?"
