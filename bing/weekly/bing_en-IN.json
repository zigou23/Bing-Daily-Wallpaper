        "description": "We are in Cala Luna, a jewel in the crown of the Gulf of Orosei in eastern Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This beach is known for its limestone cliffs, where nature has carved out caves that open directly onto the sea. Orosei, a town of about 7,000 residents in the Baronie region, is nestled in the Cedrino Valley just 2.5 kilometres from the sea. Its economy thrives on agriculture, marble quarrying and tourism. This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 kilometres, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights. Every May, the town celebrates the festivals of Sant'Isidoro and Santa Maria 'e Mare with traditional processions. During the festivities, the local flavours shine—especially in seadas, a special dessert sprinkled with golden strawberry-tree honey."

        "description": "Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida, United States, is Rainbow Springs State Park. This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the crystal-clear Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a more than 1,800-square-kilometre area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River."

        "description": "That bright fish hiding in the anemone? That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection."

        "description": "Every July, India celebrates its bond with nature through Van Mahotsav. The name comes from Sanskrit: 'Van' meaning forest and 'Mahotsav' meaning grand festival. This green tradition was started in July 1947 by an Indian historian and botanist, Mohinder Singh Randhawa. In 1950, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, then Minister of Food and Agriculture, made it an annual event in the first week of July, officially naming it Van Mahotsav."

        "description": "Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot the planet. Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 2,000 square kilometres of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like United States' Barringer, Canada's Manicouagan and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth."

        "description": "Every June 29, the International Day of the Tropics shines a light on the equator-hugging zone where the sun sticks around, and climate conversations get real. The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation and fast-paced urban growth."
