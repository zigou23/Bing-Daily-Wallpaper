        "description": "Some photos capture nature's grand acts. Great photos reveal even more in a single frame: the delicate balance between immense power and fragile beauty that surrounds us on Earth. Today's image of a natural arch carved into an Antarctic iceberg does exactly that—a conversation starter about grandeur, vulnerability, our environment and its present and future."

        "description": "Do you know what people bought at Christmas markets 567 years ago? Not costly ornaments or fancy souvenirs but candles, spices, local goods, knitted items and toys. Leipzig's Christmas market began in 1458 and quickly became a favourite stop for merchants and locals alike. Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on the news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolised more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine."

        "description": "Picture 54 square kilometres of open land, wildlife on the move, and a stag flaunting its crown of antlers. In 1909, husband and wife Anton Kröller and Helene Kröller-Müller began building a private estate in Gelderland, Netherlands—what we now know as De Hoge Veluwe National Park. Their vision? To merge art and nature. They brought it to life by placing artwork within the landscape, like 'Three Upright Motives' by English sculptor Henry Moore in the Pampelse Zand and the President Steyn stone bench by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, among others."

Opened in 1870, this Victorian marvel in East Sussex has survived tempests, fires and even wars. Stretching gracefully into the English Channel, the pier started life as a docking point for steamers. Over time, it evolved into a place where you can stroll above the water, lose a few coins to an arcade machine and gain a few back in memories."

        "description": "Ancient yet vibrant, twisted yet resilient, olive trees can live for over a thousand years. Even when scarred or hollowed, their trunks still send out fresh leaves each season—a living record of survival through drought, wind and fire. Cultivated by humans for a millennia, olives have carried both practical and symbolic weight through the ages: their oil was pressed for anointing, medicine and daily sustenance; crowns of their leaves graced Olympic victors; and their branches became a lasting emblem of peace."

        "description": "Ever heard coins clinking louder than applause? That's the Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy, for you—a spot where history, hope and selfie sticks collide. Completed in 1762, it marks the endpoint of one of ancient Rome's earliest aqueducts, the Aqua Virgo, which still supplies water today. The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 26-metre marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses."
