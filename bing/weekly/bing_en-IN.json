        "description": "There's a mountain in Switzerland that's always looking down on you—but don't take it personally. At over 3,000 metres, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St. Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. This alpine peak hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics and still boasts some of the most famous ski runs in the country. The 'Piz Nair Wall' is known for its challenging downhill skiing and events like the 2003 World Championship downhill race. Come summer, the snow clears but the trails stay hot."

        "description": "Just outside Arches National Park in Utah, United States, lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing photographers, nature lovers and hikers. Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert."

Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories."

        "description": "Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes. With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. Santa Maddalena is small, quiet and deeply rooted in local Ladin and Tyrolean traditions. Wooden chalets dot the green hills, and cows graze in meadows that seem painted into place. Although it feels remote, the village is a gateway to some of the Dolomites' best hiking, including trails through Puez-Odle Nature Park."

        "description": "With a roar that echoes across the plains, lions have long captured the human imagination. On August 10, World Lion Day invites us to celebrate these iconic big cats while raising awareness about their declining numbers and the urgent need for conservation. One of the best places to witness lions in the wild is Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, featured here. Nestled in the heart of East Africa, this vast savannah is home to around 850 to 900 lions."

        "description": "Some bonds go beyond words—they're tied, like the timeless connection between brothers and sisters. Featured here is a rakhi—a ceremonial thread that symbolises love, protection and the bond between siblings. Traditionally made from simple cotton, today's rakhis have become colourful and ornate, woven with beads, sequins and creative designs. The ritual of tying a rakhi is at the heart of Raksha Bandhan, a festival widely celebrated across South Asia, especially in Hindu households."

        "description": "No voice is loud enough to drown out the roar of Iguazú Falls. The sheer presence of this natural wonder is overwhelming as it straddles the border between Argentina and Brazil. This vast waterfall system stretches more than 3 kilometres and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist. Today's image captures one of the spectacular sights on the Argentine side—The Three Musketeers Falls, a trio of powerful streams plunging side by side into the Iguazú River below, framed by lush subtropical rainforest. Interestingly, although the falls are located in Argentina, they are only visible and accessible from the Brazilian side."
