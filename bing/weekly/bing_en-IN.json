        "description": "Every July 28, World Nature Conservation Day reminds us that protecting nature isn't optional—it's essential. Mongolia's vast grasslands, featured today, are a powerful example. These ecosystems are among the largest intact temperate grasslands on Earth, stretching thousands of square kilometres of open steppe. They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard. While the day isn't tied to a single founding organisation, it aligns with the mission of global conservation leaders like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has worked to protect biodiversity since 1948."

        "description": "Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey."

        "description": "As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient and vital. Today, on International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, we honour these extraordinary trees and the critical role they play in sustaining life on our planet. Mangroves are nature's coastal guardians. With their arching and salt-filtering roots, they thrive where few trees can—anchored in brackish water, enduring tides and shifting sands. They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilise sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs and birds."

        "description": "If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe."

        "description": "Not everything majestic stands above ground—some wonders lie beneath. Just a short drive from Gandhinagar in Gujarat, the Adalaj Stepwell is one such marvel, steeped in centuries-old stories that make it one of India's most enchanting stepwells. Built in 1498, this five-storey-deep stepwell is more than just a rainwater reservoir. According to legend, in the 15th century, Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty began constructing a stepwell to relieve his drought-stricken kingdom. Before its completion, he was killed by Mohammed Begda, a neighbouring ruler, who seized control of the region. The Rana's widow, Rani Roopba, agreed to marry Begda if he completed the stepwell—only to take her own life once it was finished."

        "description": "In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City. At less than 0.5 square kilometres, it's the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual centre of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history and devotion. At its core stands St Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings."

        "description": "As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, United States, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 950 square kilometres, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats."
