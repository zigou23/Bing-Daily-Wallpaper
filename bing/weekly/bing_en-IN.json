        "description": "Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing. But coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, pollution and overfishing have put over 70% of coral reefs at risk—a figure expected to rise in the coming years."

        "description": "Every July 20, we celebrate Moon Day, marking the historic moment when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon in 1969. With his iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin. The moon landing was the result of US President John F. Kennedy's bold 1961 goal to send a man to the moon and return him safely before the decade's end. Apollo 11 launched from Kennedy Space Centre, Florida, on July 16, 1969, reaching lunar orbit by July 19. On July 20, the Eagle lunar module touched down, and the world held its breath as history unfolded."

Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators."

        "description": "The Bahamas is an archipelagic island country comprising more than 3,000 islands, cays and islets. Nestled in the Atlantic Ocean, just southeast of Florida and northeast of Cuba, the Bahamas is famous for its beautiful waters, white sandy beaches and vibrant coral reefs. Every corner of the Bahamas is a shade card of blue, but the most captivating of all are the turquoise waters that surround the islands. The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkelling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, the sea glows with a brilliance that feels almost magical."

        "description": "If you're looking for a scent-sational summer trip, follow your nose to the Plateau de Valensole in Provence, France. From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 500 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 800 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation. Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail, and let your summer bloom with lavender memories."

        "description": "The Temple of Philae, often called the Temple of Isis, is one of Egypt's most enchanting ancient sites. Originally built on Philae Island, it was moved to nearby Agilkia Island to save it from flooding. The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past."

It is where Prince Siddhartha attained enlightenment beneath the Bodhi Tree and became the Buddha. Marked by the towering Mahabodhi Temple and centuries of devotion, this site draws pilgrims, monks and spiritual seekers from across the globe. Within this spiritually resonant landscape lies a lesser-known, yet deeply, revered corner—Muchalinda Sarovar, or the Lotus Pond. It is believed to be the site where Buddha spent his sixth week in meditation following his enlightenment."
