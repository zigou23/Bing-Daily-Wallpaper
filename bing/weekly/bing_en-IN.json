        "description": "In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village met unexpected resistance. Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience. It reminds us that Pride began with bricks, not branding. So, as rainbow flags wave each June, remember the power of resistance—and that the first Pride was a riot with a cause."

        "description": "Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around. The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required."

        "description": "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be around 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide."

        "description": "As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, the Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of the world's most famous music destinations. Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just one British pound, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore."

        "description": "This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece. What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971."

        "description": "Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in Saxony, Germany? Dresden brings the story. The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt."

Established in 2017 by Rainforest Partnership—a nonprofit environmental organisation—the day raises awareness about the importance of rainforests and mobilises efforts to protect them. In the US, the occasion is marked with community tree- plantings, school projects and social media campaigns that highlight conservation successes. Many botanical gardens host special exhibits, while environmental groups run fundraising challenges to support on-the-ground protection efforts."
