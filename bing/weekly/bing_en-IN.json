        "description": "If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe."

        "description": "Not everything majestic stands above ground—some wonders lie beneath. Just a short drive from Gandhinagar in Gujarat, the Adalaj Stepwell is one such marvel, steeped in centuries-old stories that make it one of India's most enchanting stepwells. Built in 1498, this five-storey-deep stepwell is more than just a rainwater reservoir. According to legend, in the 15th century, Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty began constructing a stepwell to relieve his drought-stricken kingdom. Before its completion, he was killed by Mohammed Begda, a neighbouring ruler, who seized control of the region. The Rana's widow, Rani Roopba, agreed to marry Begda if he completed the stepwell—only to take her own life once it was finished."

        "description": "In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City. At less than 0.5 square kilometres, it's the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual centre of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history and devotion. At its core stands St Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings."

        "description": "As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, United States, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 950 square kilometres, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats."

        "description": "Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing. But coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, pollution and overfishing have put over 70% of coral reefs at risk—a figure expected to rise in the coming years."

        "description": "Every July 20, we celebrate Moon Day, marking the historic moment when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the moon in 1969. With his iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin. The moon landing was the result of US President John F. Kennedy's bold 1961 goal to send a man to the moon and return him safely before the decade's end. Apollo 11 launched from Kennedy Space Centre, Florida, on July 16, 1969, reaching lunar orbit by July 19. On July 20, the Eagle lunar module touched down, and the world held its breath as history unfolded."

Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators."
