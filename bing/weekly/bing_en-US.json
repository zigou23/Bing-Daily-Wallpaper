        "description": "As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient, and vital. Today, on International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, we honor these extraordinary trees and the critical role they play in sustaining life on our planet."

        "description": "If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking color to neighborhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonization, maritime trade, and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 60°F in winter to 80°F in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe."

        "description": "Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion? Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes, and showing up at every family gathering. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair."

        "description": "In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City. At just 121 acres, it's the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history, and devotion. At its core stands St. Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, which houses Michelangelo's famed ceiling, are other must-sees. Despite its size, Vatican City has its own postal service, telephone system, and banking system."

        "description": "As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of color. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles, and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor center and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats."

        "description": "Every third week of July, Coral Reef Awareness Week reminds us that beneath the ocean's surface lies a world as rich and complex as any rainforest. Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here off the coast of Bonaire in the Caribbean Netherlands—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing."

Uttering the iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin."
