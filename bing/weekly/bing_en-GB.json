        "description": "It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish! Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either."

        "description": "There's a mountain in Switzerland that's always looking down on you—but don't take it personally. At 3,056 metres, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. At the top? A viewing platform and that famous ibex (an alpine goat) statue. There's also a restaurant where you can eat inside a glass cube with 360° views."

        "description": "Just outside Arches National Park in Utah lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing photographers, nature lovers and hikers. Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country. Also known as Little Rainbow Bridge, it shares visual similarities with the iconic Rainbow Bridge arch near Lake Powell—but Corona Arch holds its own in a more peaceful setting."

        "description": "Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild. Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times."

With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. The Dolomites themselves—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—rise dramatically behind the village, their pale limestone faces glowing pink at sunset in a phenomenon locals call 'enrosadira.'"
