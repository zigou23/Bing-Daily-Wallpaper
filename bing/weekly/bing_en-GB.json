        "description": "Today, Canada turns another year older. Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day' in the American sense, it's the closest thing to it. Locals celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts and community events. Ottawa, the capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill. Red-and-white flags, maple leaf face paint and singalongs of the national anthem, 'O Canada,' are all part of the day."

        "description": "Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot the planet. Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth."

        "description": "Every June 29, the International Day of the Tropics shines a light on the equator-hugging zone where the sun sticks around and climate conversations get real. The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation and fast-paced urban growth."

        "description": "The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, California, are the most accessible and iconic dunes in the park. They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities."

        "description": "Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around. The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. This amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights."

        "description": "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide."

        "description": "As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of the world's most famous music destinations. Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just £1, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore."
