        "description": "Every December, as morning unfolds, a chorus of rattling calls fills the marshes of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. This 57,000-acre (23,000-hectare) sanctuary in central New Mexico, United States, prepares to stage one of nature's most stirring performances as sandhill cranes return from their seasonal journey. Soon, tens of thousands of snow geese and other migratory birds join the scene, filling the sky with movement and sound."

        "description": "Do you know what people bought at Christmas markets 567 years ago? Not costly ornaments or fancy souvenirs but candles, spices, local goods, knitted items and toys. Leipzig's Christmas market began in 1458 and quickly became a favourite stop for merchants and locals alike. Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolised more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine."

Great photos reveal even more in a single frame: the delicate balance between immense power and fragile beauty that surrounds us on Earth. Today's image of a natural arch carved into an Antarctic iceberg does exactly that—a conversation starter about grandeur, vulnerability, our environment and its present and future."

        "description": "When 30 November rolls around, Scotland doesn't just turn up the heat—it turns up the pipes. St Andrew's Day marks a national celebration of the country's patron saint, its history and all things tartan, toasted and toe-tapping. St Andrew wasn't born here—he was a fisherman from Galilee and one of Jesus' twelve apostles. According to legend, his relics were brought to the east coast of Scotland in the 4th century, giving rise to the town of St Andrews and inspiring the country's flag, the white saltire cross on blue."

        "description": "Picture 21 square miles of open land, wildlife on the move and a stag flaunting its crown of antlers. In 1909, husband and wife Anton Kröller and Helene Kröller-Müller began building a private estate in Gelderland, Netherlands—what we now know as De Hoge Veluwe National Park. Their vision? To merge art and nature. They brought it to life by placing artwork within the landscape, like 'Three Upright Motives' by English sculptor Henry Moore in the Pampelse Zand and the President Steyn stone bench by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, among others."

Opened in 1870, this Victorian marvel in East Sussex has survived tempests, fires and even wars. Stretching gracefully into the English Channel, the pier started life as a docking point for steamers. Over time, it evolved into a place where you can stroll above the water, lose a few coins to an arcade machine and gain a few back in memories."
