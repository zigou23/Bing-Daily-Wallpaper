        "description": "If winter had a battle cry, it would sound like a horn blast echoing across cobbles. Each February, the Jorvik Viking Festival in York turns history into a living, shouting, occasionally bearded event. Run by the team behind the Jorvik Viking Centre, the festival celebrates the city's past as Jórvík—from 16 to 22 February this year—a major Viking settlement from the 9th century.",

The day gained wider recognition after the International Whaling Commission's 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, which marked a major milestone in international whale conservation.",

Few symbols capture this emotion as naturally as the bleeding heart flower, pictured here. With its unmistakable heart-shaped blooms, the plant emerges each spring, growing up to 60 centimetres tall and spreading nearly 75 centimetres wide, creating a graceful, almost poetic display."

        "description": "Before bridges, rivers set the pace of travel. Now, with bridges, people do. That shift explains why cross-border links like the Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge connecting Laos and Thailand matter. Bridges come in many forms, each built to meet a specific challenge. Arch bridges manage compression, suspension bridges span long distances and concrete box-girder bridges prioritise stability and load efficiency. This bridge uses the box-girder design, making it a practical choice for crossing the wide, fast-moving Mekong River.",

Charles Darwin's observations connected variation, the survival of individuals best suited to their environment, and inheritance in ways science still builds on. His legacy rests on years of studying variation—finches, fossils, barnacles—and recognising patterns others had overlooked. When 'On the Origin of Species' was published in 1859, it offered a framework explaining how species evolve through natural selection.",

Spanning more than 3.4 million acres (1.34 million hectares) across California and Nevada in the United States, it is the largest national park in the contiguous United States. Across this vast expanse, salt flats, volcanic hills, sweeping sand dunes and distant snowcapped peaks create a landscape shaped by time and extremes. From the soaring heights of Telescope Peak, which rises over 3,300 metres above the desert floor, to the depths of Badwater Basin, 86 metres below sea level, the park is a study in contrasts.",

Part of a protected nature reserve, these dramatic rock formations are admired for their ecological value and visual impact. Es Vedrà rises around 400 metres straight from the sea, its sheer limestone cliffs resembling a mountain range. Nearby, the jagged outline of Es Vedranell has earned it the nickname 'sleeping dragon,' appearing to guard its larger sibling.",
