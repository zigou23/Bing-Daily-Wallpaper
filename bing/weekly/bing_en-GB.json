        "description": "Every July, nature enthusiasts gather for National Moth Week to celebrate the beauty and diversity of moths. Featured in today's image is the luna moth, a species whose charm rivals that of butterflies. Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators."

        "description": "Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing. But coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, pollution and overfishing have put over 70% of coral reefs at risk—a figure expected to rise in the coming years."

From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated at 590 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 300 square miles, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation."

        "description": "The Temple of Philae, often called the Temple of Isis, is one of Egypt's most enchanting ancient sites. Originally built on Philae Island, it was moved to nearby Agilkia Island to save it from flooding. The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past."

        "description": "Get ready for one of the most dazzling celestial displays of the year—the Perseid meteor shower. Active from mid-July through late August, it reaches its spectacular peak on the night of August 12 into the early hours of August 13 this year. The Perseids light up the skies when Earth passes through a trail of icy and rocky debris left behind by Comet Swift–Tuttle, which last passed close to our planet in 1992. These meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to streak from the direction of the constellation Perseus."

        "description": "Sharks have been around for over 400 million years—outlasting dinosaurs, surviving ice ages and weathering mass extinctions. They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list."

These natural mineral combinations have done more than just sit around—they've built the Earth's crust and helped humans shape history. From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilisation, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty and recognise the rich variety they add to our world."
