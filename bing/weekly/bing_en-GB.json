        "description": "There's something about the way animals move through the grasslands of the Maasai Mara, bathed in golden rays, that makes you pause and simply watch. This stretch of savanna in southwestern Kenya teems with wildlife—from elephants stomping through bushes to cheetahs scanning the horizon. Yet sometimes it's the smaller creatures that grab attention—like the Thomson's gazelles featured in today's image."

        "description": "We are living in a full house, and it is getting fuller. With 8.2 billion people and counting, World Population Day highlights how that growth affects cities, food and the future. First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability."

First recorded by Europeans in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived, the islands were initially under Spanish rule. They later came briefly under American control before becoming a British colony. After decades of legal negotiations and a growing push for self-governance, the Bahamas transitioned to full independence on this day in 1973."

        "description": "Argentina, a nation of sweeping pampas, rich culture and a bold identity, celebrates its Independence Day today. This pivotal date marks the moment in 1816 when delegates from across the region gathered in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán to declare freedom from Spanish colonial rule. The road to independence was not easy; it followed years of internal struggles and revolutions influenced by global movements, including the American and French revolutions. But the resolve of the Argentine people prevailed."

Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 345,000 acres (141,903 hectares) and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 3,000 metres. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls and a maze of narrow, winding valleys."

It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

        "description": "Every summer, the world's best cyclists take on one of the most gruelling athletic events in modern sports—the Tour de France. Beginning this year on July 5 and concluding on July 27, the 2025 race will span 21 stages and over 2,000 miles across France. First held in 1903 to boost newspaper sales, the Tour has grown into cycling's most iconic race. Riders compete in mountain climbs, sprints and time trials, with the race traditionally ending in Paris—though the 2025 edition will once again skip the Champs-Élysées finish, following last year's modifications due to Olympic preparations."
