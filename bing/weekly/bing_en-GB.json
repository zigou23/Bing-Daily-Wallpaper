        "description": "Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around. The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. This amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights."

        "description": "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire Coast near Bermagui in New South Wales, Australia. This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide."

        "description": "As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of the world's most famous music destinations. Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just £1, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore."

        "description": "This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece. What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971."

        "description": "Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in Saxony, Germany? Dresden brings the story. The city, once called 'the Florence on the Elbe,' was nearly wiped off the map in 1945 during World War II. Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt."

        "description": "Experience the magic of the summer solstice at Seljalandsfoss waterfall in Iceland. Today, the Northern Hemisphere celebrates the longest day of the year, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky. Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event. The 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic."
