        "description": "Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion? Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes and showing up at every family gathering. The bond may stretch over time and distance, but it seldom fades. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair."

        "description": "In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City. At just 121 acres, it's the smallest independent nation in the world, yet its reach spans centuries and continents. Home to the pope and the spiritual centre of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history and devotion. At its core stands St Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings."

        "description": "As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour. The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats."

        "description": "Every summer, the royal gates swing open and the red carpets roll out—not for visiting dignitaries, but for the public. Buckingham Palace—the King's official London residence—opens 19 of its State Rooms to visitors, inviting them to explore the spaces where knighthoods are conferred and presidents are welcomed. The walls are lined with masterpieces from the Royal Collection, including works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Canaletto and others. Why summer? Because the monarch is usually away. This year, the gates opened on 10 July and will remain open until 28 September."

With his iconic words, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,' Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, followed by Buzz Aldrin."

        "description": "Every July, nature enthusiasts gather for National Moth Week to celebrate the beauty and diversity of moths. Featured in today's image is the luna moth, a species whose charm rivals that of butterflies. Also known as the American moon moth, this striking insect—with its lime-green wings and white body—can be found across North America. Its caterpillars are also green and are known for their impressive size, as well as their ability to emit clicking sounds and regurgitate intestinal contents as a defence mechanism against predators."

        "description": "Coral reefs—like the staghorn coral pictured here—are home to roughly 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the seafloor. These ecosystems not only support ocean biodiversity but also protect coastlines and drive economies through tourism and fishing. But coral reefs are in crisis. Warming oceans, pollution and overfishing have put over 70% of coral reefs at risk—a figure expected to rise in the coming years."
