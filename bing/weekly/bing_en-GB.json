        "description": "No road signs, no souvenir stands—just 11 miles of mud, cliffs and sweeping views leading to one of Hawaii's most remote beaches. Kalalau Beach, at the end of Kauai's Kalalau Trail, is where tired feet meet a sandy reward. The only land access is the trail itself, a rugged trek through valleys and along coastal cliffs. During summer, some arrive by kayak, but all visitors need permits to stay."

        "description": "What do giant handshakes painted on the ground have to do with friendship? Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolising unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 1,400 square metres of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion."

        "description": "Think you can hear silence? Try sitting in a jeep in Kanha National Park in the heart of India, waiting for a Bengal tiger to appear. Every year, International Tiger Day draws attention to these powerful yet endangered big cats. Bengal tigers are more than their unmistakable orange coats and black stripes. They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments."

        "description": "Every July 28, World Nature Conservation Day reminds us that protecting nature isn't optional—it's essential. Mongolia's vast grasslands, featured today, are a powerful example. These ecosystems are among the largest intact temperate grasslands on Earth, stretching across millions of acres of open steppe. They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard."

        "description": "Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey."

        "description": "If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe."
