        "description": "A red fox standing in the snowfall of Grand Teton National Park is more than a picturesque moment—it offers a glimpse into the resilience of one of North America's most adaptable predators. This small carnivore is instantly recognisable by its sharp gaze and thick, fiery coat that helps it thrive even in Wyoming's harsh winter conditions. Snow muffles sound, yet the animal's extraordinary hearing allows it to detect prey moving beneath the surface. You can almost imagine it pausing amid the drifting flakes, ears rotating, body perfectly still, waiting for the faintest rustle.",

        "description": "Today we celebrate the birthday of Ansel Adams, an American photographer whose vision helped shape the world's perception of Yosemite National Park in California, United States. Yosemite is renowned for its granite walls, dramatic waterfalls and striking light, all of which have inspired generations of artists. One of its most intriguing sights is the Firefall, a term that refers to two distinct events in the park's history. For decades, visitors gathered at Glacier Point to watch an artificial Firefall, in which embers were pushed off the cliff in a glowing stream of fire.",

The formation, carved into ancient rock and framed by sand and sea, looks uncannily alive, as though the land itself is watching you. Shaped over thousands of years by ice and water, it has become one of the region's most captivating sights.",

        "description": "This species missed the domestication memo and kept going on its own terms. Say hello to Przewalski's horse, considered the last truly wild horse on Earth. Once widespread across Central Asia, it disappeared from the wild in the 1960s after decades of hunting, habitat loss and competition with livestock. Its survival depended on an unlikely lifeline: a small number of individuals captured by early 20th‑century collectors, which became the foundation of all modern Przewalski's horses."

This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the rhythms of the seasons. Red lanterns—like the ones shown in today's image—are widely associated with the celebration. The holiday falls on the new moon between 21 January and 20 February and has been observed for more than 2,000 years. In 2024, UNESCO added the Spring Festival to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, recognising its cultural and historical importance."
