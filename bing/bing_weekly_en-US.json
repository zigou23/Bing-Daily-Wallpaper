        "description": "Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

        "description": "They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe, and zero interest in your deadlines. Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognizing these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the father of sea turtle conservation. His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behavior and fighting for their protection."

        "description": "For Father's Day, we're featuring a male lesser rhea (aka Darwin's rhea) with his chicks in Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile. From the moment the chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles, and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly 6 months, this bird father teaches and protects the chicks, with many staying close until maturity. Talk about going above and beyond for your kids!"

It was only when Congress passed the Flag Resolution on June 14, 1777, that the Stars and Stripes design was adopted as the official flag of the United States. To commemorate this historic milestone, then-president Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 as Flag Day in 1916—a tribute to the banner that came to represent America's identity, values, and unity."

This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site, and even a lookout for whale-watching."

        "description": "They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering up to 59 inches tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot."
