        "description": "Not so long ago, humanity took its first step beyond Earth. For thousands of years, we gazed at the stars, dreaming of what lay beyond. Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveler."

        "description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

        "description": "April 10 rolls around, and suddenly, childhood rivalries, inside jokes, and borrowed clothes come flooding back. Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you, and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Although Siblings Day is not a federally recognized holiday, it has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. Since 1995, the Siblings Day Foundation has worked to celebrate this occasion and the unique connection shared by brothers and sisters."

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky."

Called Algar de Benagil in Portuguese, this sea cave, seen in today's image, draws adventurers, photographers, and nature enthusiasts from across the world. With its limestone walls, circular skylight, and turquoise waters, its interior looks like a natural cathedral."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate International Beaver Day. Established in 2009 by Beavers Wetlands & Wildlife, this day highlights the vital role beavers play in our ecosystems. Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 3 feet long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?"

        "description": "Libraries are magical places. They are home to books full of stories and knowledge, provide easy access to resources that might not be affordable for all, and offer spaces for book clubs, author talks, and other social gatherings. Without a doubt, our society benefits from libraries in several ways. To motivate people to read and take advantage of these institutions, the National Book Committee initiated an event series. The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture. The George Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has earned the prestigious nickname, 'the cathedral of books.' Take today's image as inspiration for the theme of the 2025 National Library Week: 'Drawn to the Library.'"
