        "description": "A global shoutout to the planet we all call home. On World Environment Day, the world hits pause to reflect and act for a greener future. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society."

        "description": "The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches, and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 950 feet into the sky—perfect for rock climbing."

        "description": "If there's one place that brings the cycling spirit to life, it's the Netherlands. For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking."

Gardening not only connects us to nature but also boosts our mental health and physical well-being. Just spending time outdoors provides Vitamin D from the sun, which helps our bones stay strong and supports a healthy immune system."

        "description": "'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales."

        "description": "You'll hear it before you see it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers angled in it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up next to it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."
