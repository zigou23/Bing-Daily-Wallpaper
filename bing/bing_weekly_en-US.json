        "description": "'Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there,' Sebastian the crab once told Ariel. But are we doing enough to protect that underwater world? On June 1, we celebrate World Reef Awareness Day, a time to recognize the beauty—and fragility—of coral reef ecosystems. One magnificent example is the New Caledonian barrier reef, which wraps around Grande Terre, New Caledonia's largest island. At over 930 miles long, it's one of the longest continuous barrier reefs in the world. Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales."

        "description": "You'll hear it before you see it. The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers angled in it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up next to it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the River Ebro, this Catalan village offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

        "description": "They slip through the water like furry torpedoes, roll on riverbanks like children on a playground, and hold hands while they nap. Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild."

        "description": "Ever wanted to swim in the ocean without accidentally drinking half of it? Enter Mona Vale Rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched in Sydney's Northern Beaches area—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a human-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

Originally known as Decoration Day, the tradition began in the late 1860s after the American Civil War. Communities held springtime tributes by decorating the graves of fallen Union soldiers with flowers. Over time, it expanded to commemorate all US military personnel who died in wars. Locals observe the day with ceremonies and parades across the country."
