        "description": "You can't talk about life on Earth without talking about the ocean. This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognised by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us'. It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies."

        "description": "Long ago, in the heart of the desert, King Rawal Jaisal, the founder of Jaisalmer, envisioned a lifeline for his city. In 1156 CE, he built an artificial lake to meet the water needs of the city's inhabitants. Thus, came into being the Gadsisar Rainwater Lake, originally named Jaisalasar Lake after its creator, Rawal Jaisal. In the 14th century, Maharawal Gadsi Singh rebuilt the lake, and it was renamed in his honour—marking a new chapter in its enduring legacy."

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control."

Led by the United Nations Environment Programme, this day has been observed annually on June 5 since 1973. This year, hosted by the Republic of Korea, the event focuses on ending plastic pollution. Plastic contamination has crept into every part of the world—from oceans and forests to our own bodies in the form of microplastics. This year's campaign aims to spark change at every level of society."

        "description": "The island of Sardinia in Italy, with its rugged cliffs, secret beaches and endless shades of blue, is undeniably a Mediterranean treasure. On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself."

Something as simple as cycling can significantly boost your health, and swapping the car for a bicycle is an easy way to stay active. Moreover, cycling helps reduce pollution, eases traffic congestion and offers an affordable transport option for those without access to cars. Because of all these benefits, the United Nations dedicated June 3 as World Bicycle Day—a day to celebrate everything this amazing two-wheeler stands for."

        "description": "For decades, voices across Telangana echoed with the hope of identity and self-governance. Once part of the Telugu-speaking Hyderabad princely state, the region was merged with Andhra Pradesh in 1956. What followed was one of South India's longest statehood movements. After years of protests and political pushback, the dream became a reality on 2 June 2014. Telangana Day now honours that hard-won journey—a story of resilience, separation and a future reclaimed."
