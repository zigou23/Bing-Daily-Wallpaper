        "description": "World Rainforest Day is not just a calendar event—it's a call to action. Established in 2017 by Rainforest Partnership—a nonprofit environmental organisation—the day raises awareness about the importance of rainforests and mobilises efforts to protect them. In the US, the occasion is marked with community tree- plantings, school projects and social media campaigns that highlight conservation successes. Many botanical gardens host special exhibits, while environmental groups run fundraising challenges to support on-the-ground protection efforts."

        "description": "There's something enduring about the calm that settles in when you roll out a yoga mat and take that first deep breath. With its roots in ancient India, yoga has long been a go-to for finding balance—both in body and mind. And it's not just a personal practice anymore. In 2014, the United Nations decided it was worth honouring globally, officially marking 21 June as the International Day of Yoga, a global nod to this age-old path to wellness."

        "description": "Featured here, Seljalandsfoss, located along Iceland's South Coast, offers a stunning backdrop for this astronomical event. A 60-metre waterfall drops from cliffs that once marked the country's coastline. The cascading water is part of the Seljalandsa River, originating from the volcanic glacier Eyjafjallajökull. The volcano under the icecap last erupted in 2010, causing disruption for locals and air traffic. Visitors can walk behind the falls into a small cave, offering a unique perspective and making it a favourite spot for photographers. Floodlights illuminate the waterfall at night, creating a magical scene."

        "description": "Masai giraffes, known for their distinctive, jagged blotches, are native to East Africa. Besides Kenya and Uganda, they roam the vast plains of Tanzania's Serengeti, a name derived from the Maasai word 'seringit,' meaning 'endless plains.' Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. The Masai giraffe is easily recognised by its jagged, irregular spots and inhabits various regions across eastern Africa. It is the largest giraffe species and the tallest land animal on Earth. Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is its long neck, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of its total height."

        "description": "Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen colour vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. These butterflies mate multiple times over the course of their lives, which contributes to greater genetic diversity among their offspring. During the breeding season, males use a combination of physical displays and visual cues to attract potential mates."

        "description": "Before you hit the beach, you'll hear it—the rustle of leaves in salty air, the creak of twisted trunks, the hush of an old world. Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

        "description": "They've got built-in helmets, a slow-and-steady vibe and zero interest in your deadlines. Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognising these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection. There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable."
