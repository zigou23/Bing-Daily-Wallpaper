        "description": "They say everything's bigger in Texas, United States—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Over 3,200 square kilometres of area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

        "description": "In Lüderitz, Namibia, these birds aren't just passing through—they're standing their ground. Literally. On one leg. These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering over 120 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot. That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones."

        "description": "Wouldn't it be great to see our reflection from above in this vast expanse of water? Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 6,000 square kilometres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. The park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms."

        "description": "There is something mesmerising about cities that wear their history on their sleeves—and Dubrovnik, Croatia, is one of them. Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch close to 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognised by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us'. It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains and economies."

In 1156 CE, he built an artificial lake to meet the water needs of the city's inhabitants. Thus, came into being the Gadsisar Rainwater Lake, originally named Jaisalasar Lake after its creator, Rawal Jaisal. In the 14th century, Maharawal Gadsi Singh rebuilt the lake, and it was renamed in his honour—marking a new chapter in its enduring legacy."

On June 6, 1944, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, launching Operation Overlord, also known as D-Day. This complex assault, involving coordinated air, sea and land forces, marked the beginning of the campaign to liberate Western Europe from Nazi control."
