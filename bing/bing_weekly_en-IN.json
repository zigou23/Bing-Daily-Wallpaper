        "description": "Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. It is important that we reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators."

        "description": "Today is Maha Shivaratri, a festival marked by fasting, meditation and an all-night vigil in honour of Lord Shiva. Celebrated between February and March, it falls on the fourteenth night of the waning moon in the Hindu month of Phalguna. But what makes this festival truly special? It marks the union of Shiva and Parvati and the powerful Tandava dance performed by Shiva. What would be a better place to experience the divine presence of Shiva than Tungnath, featured here? One of the highest Shiva temples in the world, Tungnath is perched high in the Himalayas at 3,680 metres. This sacred site, in Uttarakhand's Rudraprayag district, is the loftiest of the five Panch Kedar temples, and sits just below the majestic Chandrashila peak."

        "description": "Perched dramatically on a tidal islet in Loch Laich, Argyll, Castle Stalker is one of Scotland's most picturesque and well-preserved medieval tower houses. Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. Despite falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer."

This cuttlefish is found in the temperate and subtropical waters of Australia, ranging from Brisbane in Queensland and Shark Bay in Western Australia to as far south as Tasmania. Featured here is a giant cuttlefish in Whyalla, South Australia. In this region, where males are significantly outnumbered, a unique gender imbalance fuels intense competition for mating rights."

        "description": "Over 90 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,500 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern."

        "description": "Today we are at the Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson's idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking structure more than 190 metres tall that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva.'  It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva, and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats Mountain range."
