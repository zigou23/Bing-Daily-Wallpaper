        "description": "One of India's most sought-after destinations, the Kedarkantha peak is a trekker's paradise, renowned for its snow-covered trails. In the Govind Pashu Vihar National Park of Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, this mountain peak stands at 3,800 metres. What sets this spot apart is its exhilarating summit climb, which attracts countless trekkers to the Indian Himalayas. The forests surrounding Kedarkantha are dominated by towering pine trees, with deodar, oak and rhododendron adding to the region's greenery. The rare blue poppy and other blooms bring colour to the terrain. This area is also home to species like the Himalayan snow cock, kala titar, chakor, magpie, thrush, paradise flycatcher, parakeet and bulbul. Beyond its avian residents, the region shelters a variety of wildlife, including the elusive Himalayan black bear. Marmots and various other rodents also inhabit this zone, while leopards, tigers, barking deer (kakar) and sambhar occasionally make an appearance."

        "description": "Today isn't just another day; it's a statement. Happy International Women's Day, everyone! It's a global celebration of resilience, rights and remarkable women. First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labour movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions and voting rights. Today's image features the Fearless Girl, boldly facing the New York Stock Exchange in the United States. Unveiled in 2017, the statue was commissioned to highlight the lack of women in corporate leadership roles. With her fists on her hips, head held high and a confident stance, she symbolises female empowerment."

        "description": "Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace. Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh more than 10 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of over 30 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."

        "description": "Today, we are in a wildlife-packed wonderland with rainforests older than the Amazon—Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani province, southern Thailand. Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. And then there's Cheow Lan Lake—a reservoir created for hydropower in 1982 when the Rajjaprabha Dam was built. Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016."

This monument is on the eastern bank of the Musi River, with the famous Laad Bazaar to the west and the Makkah Masjid to the southwest. Built in 1591 by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the Charminar is an architectural marvel shrouded in legend."

        "description": "What better time to shine a spotlight on nature than on World Wildlife Day? This day serves as a reminder that wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility. This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa."
