        "description": "Imagine a world without colour, music or design—how dull would life be? Every April 15, World Art Day reminds us of the beauty, inspiration and culture that art brings into our lives. Established by the International Association of Art in honour of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this global celebration promotes creativity in all its forms. Art has been a cornerstone of human civilisation for thousands of years, from prehistoric cave paintings to digital masterpieces. Beyond the sculptures and paintings found in galleries and museums, art also lives in street murals, sand sculptures and even beach art, as seen here, proving that creativity knows no bounds. World Art Day, officially observed in 21 countries, is a celebration for everyone, whether you're a collector, a creator or simply someone who finds joy in the colors and textures of everyday life."

        "description": "Ambedkar Jayanti is a reminder of the life and legacy of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, India's visionary leader, social reformer and champion of equality. Born on this day in 1891, he embodied the values he stood for, with some even calling his birthday 'Equality Day.' Grand processions at Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai and Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur draw large crowds, while tributes and cultural events take place nationwide. National leaders honour Ambedkar at the Parliament. Beyond India, the celebration resonates globally, especially among Dalits, Adivasis, labourers, women and those inspired by his Buddhist ideals."

        "description": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants."

        "description": "Not so long ago, humanity took its first step beyond Earth. For thousands of years, we gazed at the stars, dreaming of what lay beyond. Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller."

        "description": "From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back. Interestingly, tulips didn't originate here. These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

        "description": "April 10 rolls around, and suddenly, childhood rivalries, inside jokes and borrowed clothes come flooding back. Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Siblings Day has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. In India, the bond between siblings is celebrated each year through Raksha Bandhan, a tradition where sisters tie a rakhi—a sacred thread—around their brother's wrist. This heartfelt gesture symbolises love, protection and the deep connection shared between siblings."

When the sun is positioned well below the horizon, during this brief window, the lingering sunlight casts a deep blue hue across the sky."
