        "description": "Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea."

        "description": "If walls could whisper, Humayun's Tomb would share stories of love, legacy and beautiful artistry. This magnificent monument in Delhi, is India's first-ever garden tomb and the final resting place of Mughal emperor Humayun. This grand structure was commissioned by Humayun's chief consort, Bega Begum (also called Haji Begum). Determined to honour the emperor's legacy, Bega Begum entrusted Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas with bringing her vision to reality. However, he passed away before the project's completion, leaving his son, Sayyid Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyath Ud Din, to carry forward his work. Construction began in 1565, nine years after Humayun's passing, and was completed in 1572."

        "description": "Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

        "description": "Today's image features a tree frog. Frogs don't always get the attention they deserve. These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 2 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species."

Welcome to Ostuni, in the Apulia region of Italy. Apulia is a southeastern area of the country, located in the 'heel of Italy's boot.' It has the longest coastline of any mainland region in the country and is home to numerous attractions, including beaches, cliffs and charming cities like the one we see in today's image."

On the right, we see a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its more than 134-metre summit for breathtaking panoramic views."
