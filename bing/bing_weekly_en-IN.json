        "description": "Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes more than 60 kilometres in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes."

The mighty Ganga cuts through the region, flowing from west to east."

        "description": "March 21 marks the International Day of Forests, a global observance aimed at celebrating the vital role forests play in supporting biodiversity and combating climate change. First established by the United Nations in 2013, this day encourages worldwide efforts, such as tree-planting campaigns, to raise awareness about the importance of forests and trees for future generations. One of the most breathtaking places to observe the richness of forests is the Danum Valley Conservation Area in Sabah on the Malaysian island of Borneo, starring in today's image. This over 400-square-kilometre sanctuary is home to an ancient, 130-million-year-old rainforest, teeming with rare species like Bornean orangutans, clouded leopards and over 270 bird species."

        "description": "Sedona, Arizona, is a place where nature, history and spirituality converge amidst stunning red rock formations. These fiery sandstone creations, part of the Schnebly Hill Formation, were shaped over millions of years during the Permian Period as sediment accumulated in an ancient sea. Over time, erosion has further sculpted Sedona's landscapes, which now glow brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. Notable formations such as Wilson Mountain, Seven Sacred Pools and Cathedral Rock offer iconic views. Native American tribes called this region home, leaving behind awe-inspiring rock art, cliff dwellings and pueblos such as Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot."
