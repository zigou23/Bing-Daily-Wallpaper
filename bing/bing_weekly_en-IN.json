        "description": "It's not every day you see a desert burst into colours, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona in the United States, when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil."

Since 1961, this annual event by the International Theatre Institute (ITI) has united audiences and artists in a shared appreciation of storytelling, creativity and culture. Every year, a renowned theatre figure is invited by ITI to deliver a message that resonates across the industry. Their words are translated into more than 50 languages and shared with people all over the world. So, what better place to celebrate today than at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus? Located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, this stone Roman theatre has been setting the scene for performances for nearly two millennia. Built in 161 CE by the wealthy Roman Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, this ancient venue has hosted everything from classical tragedies to modern-day concerts. Despite the passing centuries, its acoustics still strike the right chord."

        "description": "Manatees don't rush through life—they float. These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. There are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get."

A time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves, and one particularly famous ring. But why this date? March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. This day was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favourite moments and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?"

        "description": "Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes more than 60 kilometres in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes."
