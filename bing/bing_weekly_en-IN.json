        "description": "Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering over 4,900 square kilometres. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat."

The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California, United States, are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 110 metres high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods."

Designated in 1987, it safeguards a landscape of towering limestone cliffs, hidden caves, dense forests and untouched shorelines. As part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, it's a haven for species that have adapted to its rugged terrain, like black bears, massasauga rattlesnakes and white-tailed deer."

World Penguin Day is all about celebrating these flightless birds while raising awareness about their habitats. This day originated at McMurdo Station, an American research centre on Ross Island in Antarctica, where scientists observed Adélie penguins starting their yearly migration around this time. Inspired by this natural event, the observance was created to shed light on penguins' role in the ecosystem, the threats they face and the urgency of protecting their habitats."

        "description": "Kenai Fjords National Park is a gem on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. Stretching over 2,500 square kilometres, this landscape features towering fjords, winding river valleys and alpine landscapes. More than half of its terrain is blanketed in ice, with glaciers dominating 51% of its area. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons."

        "description": "'All the world's a stage ...' and only a few have shaped that stage like William Shakespeare. Every April 23, we celebrate Shakespeare Day, honouring one of England's greatest playwrights and poets. This date is special as it marks both his birth and death. Born in 1564, Shakespeare revolutionised English literature with unforgettable works like 'Hamlet,' 'Macbeth,' and 'Romeo and Juliet.' Even four centuries after his death, his influence remains undeniable—his stories continue to captivate, challenge and inspire."

The largest hot spring in the United States, it spans over 110 metres across and reaches temperatures of 71°C. This geothermal marvel is fuelled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters."
