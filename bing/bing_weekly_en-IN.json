        "description": "Imagine a world without the pyramids, the Great Wall or ancient cave cities—hard to picture, right? That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too. A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world."

They look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colours, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too."

        "description": "Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the passage of time. Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse."

        "description": "Imagine a world without colour, music or design—how dull would life be? Every April 15, World Art Day reminds us of the beauty, inspiration and culture that art brings into our lives. Established by the International Association of Art in honour of Leonardo da Vinci's birthday, this global celebration promotes creativity in all its forms. Art has been a cornerstone of human civilisation for thousands of years, from prehistoric cave paintings to digital masterpieces. Beyond the sculptures and paintings found in galleries and museums, art also lives in street murals, sand sculptures and even beach art, as seen here, proving that creativity knows no bounds. World Art Day, officially observed in 21 countries, is a celebration for everyone, whether you're a collector, a creator or simply someone who finds joy in the colors and textures of everyday life."

        "description": "Ambedkar Jayanti is a reminder of the life and legacy of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, India's visionary leader, social reformer and champion of equality. Born on this day in 1891, he embodied the values he stood for, with some even calling his birthday 'Equality Day.' Grand processions at Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai and Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur draw large crowds, while tributes and cultural events take place nationwide. National leaders honour Ambedkar at the Parliament. Beyond India, the celebration resonates globally, especially among Dalits, Adivasis, labourers, women and those inspired by his Buddhist ideals."

        "description": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants."
