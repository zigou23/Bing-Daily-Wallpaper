        "description": "They say everything's bigger in Texas—and Big Bend National Park has been living up to the slogan since forever. Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering up to 59 inches tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot."

Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 1.5 million acres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile, and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognized as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance."

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts, and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

Angeles National Forest in Southern California is home to towering pines and rugged ridgelines, and hosts a stretch of the legendary Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Winding over about 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada, the PCT is the ultimate thru-hiking dream. Designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, it traverses seven national parks, 25 national forests, and provides a unique lens through which to experience the dramatic landscapes of the American West. But you don't need to go the distance to enjoy its magic. In Southern California, portions of the trail through the San Gabriel Mountains offer great views and rewarding day hikes."

For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking."

Its vast 9,300-square-mile lagoon is home to over 2,300 fish species, endangered dugongs, green sea turtles, and migrating humpback whales."

Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up next to it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s."

Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

International Day for Biological Diversity is about celebrating this web of life that keeps our planet thriving. Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. A decline in biodiversity can increase the spread of zoonotic diseases—those transmitted from animals to humans. In contrast, protecting biodiversity strengthens our ability to prevent and respond to health crises like pandemics. Recognizing its crucial role for current and future generations, the United Nations observes this day each year to raise awareness and foster action for conserving the planet's biological treasures."

The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium, and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats, and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly, and inefficient process."

Its most recognizable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 8,000 feet tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today."

Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment, and abandonment."

While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you're joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it's a great day to appreciate Mexico's rich history and traditions. Viva Mexico!"

It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea, and the Pacific islands."

On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root."

From the smoky clubs of New Orleans to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures, and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue, and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood."

Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

The Halema'uma'u Crater is an intermittent lava lake in Kīlauea, one of Earth's most active volcanoes. Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth. The natural and cultural importance of this site led to the establishment of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park in 1916, and to it being named a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in the 1980s."

Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes, and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons."

The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder."

During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk, and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female.

Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three.

        "description": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks, and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits."

Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveler."

These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

Although Siblings Day is not a federally recognized holiday, it has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. Since 1995, the Siblings Day Foundation has worked to celebrate this occasion and the unique connection shared by brothers and sisters."

Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 3 feet long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?"

They are home to books full of stories and knowledge, provide easy access to resources that might not be affordable for all, and offer spaces for book clubs, author talks, and other social gatherings. Without a doubt, our society benefits from libraries in several ways. To motivate people to read and take advantage of these institutions, the National Book Committee initiated an event series. The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture. The George Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has earned the prestigious nickname, 'the cathedral of books.' Take today's image as inspiration for the theme of the 2025 National Library Week: 'Drawn to the Library.'"

The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen."

Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together."

These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down 10 humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin."

It's a time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves, and one particularly famous ring. But why this date? March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. The observation was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries, and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favorite moments, and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay, and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honor Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?"

These extremely arid regions receive less than 2.75 inches of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet, and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient herbivores migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes 43 miles in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes."

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal, and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theater of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life."

Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light."

During these battles, they hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs.

Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur, and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. There are trails to tackle, kayaks to paddle, and, if you're fortunate, you might even catch a glimpse of the massive (and stinky) Rafflesia flower when it's in bloom."

Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs, and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins."

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles."

His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honors his genius while promoting curiosity, science, and critical thinking."

This collection of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty, the grottoes comprise 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 56 feet tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians, and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. These caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian, and local Chinese Buddhist art. Whether you're a history lover or simply appreciate unique art, the Yungang Grottoes offer an unforgettable experience."

Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria, and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task."

The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February."

Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home."

Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece, and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker."

These little rodents are found across most of the globe, and today is their special day: Squirrel Appreciation Day. This unofficial holiday was started by a North Carolina wildlife rehabilitator to encourage people to leave out seeds and nuts for these critters. From the tiny least pygmy squirrel—just 5.5 inches long—to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at more than 4 feet, these mammals come in all shapes and sizes."

In 1963, he helped organize the March on Washington, DC, which 250,000 people attended to protest discrimination and support pending civil rights legislation. During this event, King delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, imagining America free of racism and segregation. His speech is regarded as one of America's greatest, and his leadership was instrumental in ending racial segregation of African Americans throughout many parts of the United States. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, but his life was cut short by an assassin in 1968."

The entire cave complex stretches on for around 2.5 miles, although visitors can only access about 1,000 feet of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 390-foot-long saltwater lake."

President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument in 1908, and Pinnacles would earn its status as a national park in 2013. As we celebrate the park's anniversary today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. Pinnacles owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs, and talus caves, which are created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

For the first time, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast-forward nearly 266 years, and the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artifacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes, and samurai armor."

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs, and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food, or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

        "description": "'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honor the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip."

This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colorful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts."

The 1.3-mile lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

The celebration centers around the unadorned aluminum Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus 'airing of grievances' gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they've disappointed you over the year. This can provide some much-needed catharsis at what can be a stressful time of year. The day traditionally concludes with feats of strength. Once the head of the household has been pinned, Festivus is officially over. Those who embrace this farcical holiday welcome the opportunity to let off some steam amid the Christmas build-up chaos—much like these red-crowned cranes in Hokkaido, Japan."

Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolize the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in color, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbor framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

        "description": "You might have heard of a pool of tears, but have you ever heard of a lake of tears? Well, legend has it that Lake Misurina, pictured here, in Italy's Dolomites, was born from the sorrow of a giant named Sorapis. At more than 5,700 feet above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than 1.5 miles. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalized in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots, and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

        "description": "For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird Count. Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species."

A highlight for many is the 3D light show projected onto the basilica's facade, a modern touch that brings this historic structure to life."

At up to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 400 pounds, they were used primarily as pack animals for about 6,500 years. They were also bred as a source of food, hides, tallow for candles, dung for fuel, and fabric. While inferior to alpaca and guanaco wool, llama fleece is soft, warm, durable, and fairly lightweight. It's used for clothing, rugs, and rope."

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

More than 3,500 US servicepeople were killed or wounded, and eight battleships were destroyed or damaged in less than two hours. Following Roosevelt's speech came a declaration of war and the entrance of the US into World War II. Congress named December 7 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994."

While these towers can be found in many places, today's image shows some at Mono Lake in Mono County, California. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981."

Along with prehensile tongues that are more than a foot and a half long, they use their impressive height to eat foliage found almost 20 feet from the ground. They're also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 37 mph. Giraffes are common in East Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands, and reserves."

History buffs will enjoy exploring the sea stack formation with rubbing marks believed to have been made by mammoths that roamed the area 40,000 years ago. The park is also home to historical sites like Bodega Head, where Russians built a fort in the early 1800s."

Over the years, it withstood countless battles of the Reconquista—the military campaigns waged by Christian kingdoms against Muslim rule in Spain—and of the Castilian Civil War of the 14th century."

Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures."

Spanning more than 41 square miles, this park features dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite rock. Tasmans Arch, seen in today's image, is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania."

The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins, and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 144 feet and is 112 feet tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches."

Armistice Day, as it was later named, commemorated this respite, and it became a federal holiday in 1938. A few years later, America fought in World War II, and later, the Korean War. As a result, Congress amended the holiday in 1954, exchanging the word 'Armistice' with 'Veterans' to include veterans of all the country's wars."

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

With a labyrinth of ecosystems that range from glacier-capped mountains to temperate rainforests, the park is a home for wildlife and an International Biosphere Reserve. Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image."

For convenience and to save money, many elections for state and local offices are also held on Election Day."

The village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described Grasmere, with its valley and lake of the same name, as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century and is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering."

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them."

The towering presence of Mont Blanc has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honoring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori, and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. Forced inside by incessant rain, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalized. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back.

Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgment in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings. The monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specializing in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912."

The planet is dotted with frosty dunes, largely located in the high latitudes of the northern plains. Mars' atmosphere is composed of nearly 96% carbon dioxide, which is why carbon ice forms on the surface. These dunes showcase the dynamic interaction between Mars' thin atmosphere, its surface, and seasonal temperature changes."

The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, this historic palace was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the small and shy mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia, and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown color but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells, or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilization inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

Named after the giant sequoias that dominate the landscape, the park spans more than 629 square miles and is home to wildlife such as black bears, mule deer, and over 200 species of birds, including warblers, vireos, and flycatchers . The giant sequoia trees here have been rooted for more than 2,200 years and are among Earth's oldest living organisms. The park's renowned General Sherman tree rises to an astonishing 275 feet. Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also more than 36 feet wide. Visitors flock to capture moments among these ancient giants, whose reddish-brown, fibrous bark and wide-reaching branches evoke a sense of living history."

From glaciers to waterfalls, like the one featured here today, to northern lights, this area in Vatnajökull National Park is a showcase of nature's raw beauty. Skaftafell's dramatic landscape was formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Iceland's largest ice cap Vatnajökull, stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater. Surrounded by dark lava columns resembling a heart from afar, this waterfall inspired the design of Iceland's National Theatre and the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík."

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. They're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food and using rocks to crack open shellfish, one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 sea otters in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for their dense fur for almost two centuries. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 sea otters were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban and conservation efforts have helped them rebound in their historic habitat to an estimated 125,000. Despite this success, some populations continue to struggle, and sea otters are still an endangered species. So, unlike our homepage star, we can't relax on sea otter conservation just yet."

It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country—but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales."

These sprightly mammals have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and deliver powerful kicks if threatened. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs' for safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range."

Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."

These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

While the protection of national forests and parks began in the late 1800s, untamed wilderness had dwindled to only 2.5% of US land by the 1960s. To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US."

President Grover Cleveland made the US holiday official in 1894. Today, many Americans celebrate the long weekend, which is often considered the unofficial end of summer, by grilling, hanging out with friends and family, and going to parades."

The patterns on their dotted, starry skin are as unique as a human fingerprint.

Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage."

Built in 1919, Alfanzina Lighthouse helps ships navigate dangerous waters near the town of Carvoeiro. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also has become a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit."

Their origins can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. The first roller coaster was built in early 19th-century Paris, France. Called 'Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville,' it featured wheeled carts securely attached to tracks. By the 1900s, coasters were looping the loop for the first time."

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river. It was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river' and in 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore it. They realized something incredible: It was the world's largest cave. Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 490 feet wide, and 660 feet high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-story skyscraper."

World Lizard Day is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, lizards have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take geckos—these little climbers have toe pads that let them scale walls and walk on ceilings. Then there are chameleons with their color-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, this ability is also used to communicate and regulate temperature."

Pictured behind cliffs separating it from the Adriatic Sea is the park's Telašćica Bay, which stretches inland over 6 miles and is the largest natural harbor in the Adriatic. Dotted with islets and surrounded by small islands, its dramatic cliffs tower more than 520 feet above sea level and are known locally as the 'stene.' Other features of the park include 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."

This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists, and dreamers. Famous for its mild winters and pleasant summers, it has been a filming location for movies like 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' and 'One Week.'"
