Fondly known as the 'Pale Mountains,' the Dolomites derive their name from dolomite—a carbonate mineral. Set in the northern Italian Alps, the range spans over 345,000 acres and boasts 18 soaring peaks that rise above 9,500 feet. These mountains feature sheer cliffs, lofty walls, and a maze of narrow, winding valleys."

It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands, and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it, and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities."

Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. It is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. Spine-cheeked anemonefish thrive in warm, shallow waters and stick close to their chosen sea anemone."

Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day,' it's the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country's capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill."

This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of TNT, a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan, and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth."

Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature, and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation, and fast-paced urban growth."

Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. The first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall. Holding signs and chanting for liberation, they demanded visibility, rights, and justice."

One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of color mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights."

This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers, and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide."

Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just one British pound, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture, and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore."

Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971."

        "description": "Pollinator Week is in full bloom! This year's celebration takes place from June 16 to 22. It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles, and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen color vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important."

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognizing these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the father of sea turtle conservation. His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behavior and fighting for their protection."

From the moment the chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles, and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly 6 months, this bird father teaches and protects the chicks, with many staying close until maturity. Talk about going above and beyond for your kids!"

Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts, and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the River Ebro, this Catalan village offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild."

Enter Mona Vale Rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched in Sydney's Northern Beaches area—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a human-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

Now spread across 55 acres, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom."

Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium, and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats, and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly, and inefficient process."

But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their color-shifting skills, zippy tongues, and wild adaptations. Chameleons change colors to help regulate their body temperature, attract mates, and communicate with others. Specialized skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention."

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment, and abandonment."

The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin."

While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you're joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it's a great day to appreciate Mexico's rich history and traditions. Viva Mexico!"

This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers, and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929."

On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root."

This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood."

Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

The Halema'uma'u Crater is an intermittent lava lake in Kīlauea, one of Earth's most active volcanoes. Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth. The natural and cultural importance of this site led to the establishment of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park in 1916, and to it being named a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in the 1980s."

The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder."

The males look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colors, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too. The Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk, and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates, and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface."

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina, and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honor the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse."

Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits."

This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 3 feet long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?"

Without a doubt, our society benefits from libraries in several ways. To motivate people to read and take advantage of these institutions, the National Book Committee initiated an event series. The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture. The George Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has earned the prestigious nickname, 'the cathedral of books.' Take today's image as inspiration for the theme of the 2025 National Library Week: 'Drawn to the Library.'"

Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen."

Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together."

These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down 10 humans.

In the center, we have a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbor, on the left side of the picture, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 440-foot summit for breathtaking panoramic views."

This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent. Drawing attention to California's diverse flora and rural federal lands, this event offers a temporary boost to local economies."

Schools, libraries, and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favorite moments, and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay, and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honor Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?"

These extremely arid regions receive less than 2.75 inches of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet, and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient herbivores migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes 43 miles in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes."

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal, and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theater of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life."

Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

        "description": "Feeling a bit tired? You're not alone—losing an hour to daylight saving time can leave anyone groggy. That's why Napping Day exists. Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration, and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help."

Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light."

From its beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests, and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence, and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate."

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 30 pounds. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, they hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, the desert bighorn sheep sub-species can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

The massive marine sinkhole, 1,043 feet across and 407 feet deep, was formed during the last ice age when a limestone cave system collapsed and rising sea levels flooded the area, leaving behind a striking natural wonder."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles."

The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 56 feet tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians, and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. These caves blend influences from Indian, Central Asian, and local Chinese Buddhist art. Whether you're a history lover or simply appreciate unique art, the Yungang Grottoes offer an unforgettable experience."

It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task."

The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February."

Steeped in thousands of years of tradition, this holiday marks the start of the lunisolar Chinese calendar. One of the most captivating images associated with this festival is the dragon dance, pictured here. Skilled dancers manipulate a long, flexible dragon puppet, bringing it to life with sinuous, undulating movements. The dragon, a symbol of power, dignity, and good fortune, is believed to bring luck to the community, with longer dragons bringing even more prosperity."

Since then, the river has been deepening and widening the canyon while sculpting its dramatic geographic features."

During this event, King delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, imagining America free of racism and segregation. His speech is regarded as one of America's greatest, and his leadership was instrumental in ending racial segregation of African Americans throughout many parts of the United States. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, but his life was cut short by an assassin in 1968."

As we celebrate the park's anniversary today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. Pinnacles owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs, and talus caves, which are created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast-forward nearly 266 years, and the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artifacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes, and samurai armor."

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs, and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food, or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

The Great Wall of China, one of the longest humanmade structures in the world, offers the perfect inspiration. Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys, and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! Talk about a workout—taking these stairs could rival any modern fitness challenge."

Rocks are common and few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. But forged in volcanoes or molded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history."

Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: The basement crypt, or burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall."

Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colorful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today.

The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

The celebration centers around the unadorned aluminum Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus 'airing of grievances' gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they've disappointed you over the year. This can provide some much-needed catharsis at what can be a stressful time of year. The day traditionally concludes with feats of strength. Once the head of the household has been pinned, Festivus is officially over. Those who embrace this farcical holiday welcome the opportunity to let off some steam amid the Christmas build-up chaos—much like these red-crowned cranes in Hokkaido, Japan."

This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolize the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

Sparkling strings of lights drape across the square, seen in today's image, creating a canopy that bathes the cobblestone streets in a warm, festive glow. There also stands a beautifully lit Christmas tree, surrounded by charming wooden huts selling everything from handcrafted ornaments to locally made treats like cozonac, a traditional Romanian sweet bread; vin fiert, an aromatic mulled wine; and covrigi, a type of pretzel served warm and sprinkled with salt."

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in color, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbor framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

At more than 5,700 feet above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than 1.5 miles. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalized in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots, and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species."

At up to 6 feet tall and weighing up to 400 pounds, they were used primarily as pack animals for about 6,500 years. They were also bred as a source of food, hides, tallow for candles, dung for fuel, and fabric. While inferior to alpaca and guanaco wool, llama fleece is soft, warm, durable, and fairly lightweight.

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981."

Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalized in the country's flag, a white saltire on a blue background, said to represent the cross on which he was martyred."

The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims, and invaders alike."

To celebrate their first corn harvest and thank the Native Americans who helped them, the colonists held a three-day feast."

From there, they were introduced to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then farther afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood, and fruit for millennia."

At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures."

Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania."

Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins, and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 144 feet and is 112 feet tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches."

The holiday originally celebrated a temporary halt in fighting between Allied nations and Germany during World War I—the official end of the war came the following year in 1919. Armistice Day, as it was later named, commemorated this respite, and it became a federal holiday in 1938. A few years later, America fought in World War II, and later, the Korean War. As a result, Congress amended the holiday in 1954, exchanging the word 'Armistice' with 'Veterans' to include veterans of all the country's wars."

If you have, there's a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony, or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull, and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

Unlike other wolf species, they have a marine-based diet, consisting of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters, and seals. These animals live in packs, communicating with each other through growls, barks, and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century and is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering."

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them."

The towering presence of Mont Blanc has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honoring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori, and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. Forced inside by incessant rain, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

        "description": "Madame Sherri Forest in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, is a captivating destination steeped in history and natural beauty. It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalized. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase, and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgment in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings. The monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specializing in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912."

Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the southeastern US. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which sunlight hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows, and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, this historic palace was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the small and shy mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia, and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown color but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells, or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year."

Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Our homepage stars were photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, where male and female herds are found year-round. Male walruses can reach almost 12 feet long and weigh more than 2,600 pounds. During mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Skaftafell's dramatic landscape was formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Iceland's largest ice cap Vatnajökull, stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater. Surrounded by dark lava columns resembling a heart from afar, this waterfall inspired the design of Iceland's National Theatre and the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík."

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. They're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food and using rocks to crack open shellfish, one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 sea otters in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for their dense fur for almost two centuries. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 sea otters were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban and conservation efforts have helped them rebound in their historic habitat to an estimated 125,000. Despite this success, some populations continue to struggle, and sea otters are still an endangered species. So, unlike our homepage star, we can't relax on sea otter conservation just yet."

The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals.

These sprightly mammals have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and deliver powerful kicks if threatened. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs' for safety and mutual grooming.

Hunting in particular led to the creation of World Dolphin Day in 2022 by Sea Shepherd Global, an international marine conservation group."

Seven stories below the memorial, the museum tells the story of 9/11 through exhibits, artifacts, historical records, and personal accounts, remembering the victims and those who risked their lives to save others."

This cable-stayed bridge was designed to be earthquake and wind-resistant; its deck is not fixed to the pylons, and it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Its opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

This day is dedicated to appreciating these tiny, agile birds and their role as a pollinator in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."

An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US."

President Grover Cleveland made the US holiday official in 1894.

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage."

She started buying land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations."

Ocean City was a quiet fishing village until 1875, when the Atlantic Hotel opened its doors, marking the town's transformation into a burgeoning resort destination. Today, it is a popular vacation spot, with an iconic 3-mile-long boardwalk lined with restaurants, shops, and amusement parks. Pristine sandy beaches stretching over 10 miles are perfect for sunbathing, beach volleyball, or building sandcastles, and the ocean waters beckon for a refreshing swim. Ocean City is a charming retreat that draws visitors back time and again."

Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanor when they're walking."

These days, it's a popular spot for fishing and watching surfers ride the waves out in the Pacific Ocean."

By the 1900s, coasters were looping the loop for the first time."

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river. It was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng, or 'cave of the mountain river' and in 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore it. They realized something incredible: It was the world's largest cave. Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 3.1 miles long, 490 feet wide, and 660 feet high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-story skyscraper."

Take geckos—these little climbers have toe pads that let them scale walls and walk on ceilings. Then there are chameleons with their color-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, this ability is also used to communicate and regulate temperature."

Dotted with islets and surrounded by small islands, its dramatic cliffs tower more than 520 feet above sea level and are known locally as the 'stene.' Other features of the park include 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."
