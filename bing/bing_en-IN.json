It was on this day that the Indian Independence Act of 1947 came into force, transferring legislative powers to the Indian Constituent Assembly."

At over 3,000 metres, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St. Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. This alpine peak hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics and still boasts some of the most famous ski runs in the country. The 'Piz Nair Wall' is known for its challenging downhill skiing and events like the 2003 World Championship downhill race. Come summer, the snow clears but the trails stay hot."

With its iconic church steeple set against the jagged peaks of the Dolomites—a mountain range in the Alps—it's one of the most photographed spots in the region. Santa Maddalena is small, quiet and deeply rooted in local Ladin and Tyrolean traditions. Wooden chalets dot the green hills, and cows graze in meadows that seem painted into place. Although it feels remote, the village is a gateway to some of the Dolomites' best hiking, including trails through Puez-Odle Nature Park."

The sheer presence of this natural wonder is overwhelming as it straddles the border between Argentina and Brazil. This vast waterfall system stretches more than 3 kilometres and features more than 270 individual cascades, each offering a unique display of tumbling water and shimmering mist. Today's image captures one of the spectacular sights on the Argentine side—The Three Musketeers Falls, a trio of powerful streams plunging side by side into the Iguazú River below, framed by lush subtropical rainforest. Interestingly, although the falls are located in Argentina, they are only visible and accessible from the Brazilian side."

        "description": "It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama. Ring-tailed lemurs are found only in southern and southwestern Madagascar, where they live in dry forests, spiny thickets and rocky outcrops."

Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighbourhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars."

Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations and celestial events."

It was here in 1530 that Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned, setting the stage for a dynasty that would shape Indian history, architecture and politics. Years later, Akbar began its grand transformation in 1565, and by 1573, the fort had taken on the form we see today. Walk past mammoth gates and into a world where Islamic, Persian and Hindu architecture blend seamlessly in every arch, dome and courtyard. From the public court of Diwan-e-Aam to the elegance of Diwan-e-Khas, from the Musamman Burj to intricately designed palaces and gardens, every corner speaks of power and poetic artistry. A walk here is a time-travel ticket into an empire of red walls, royal whispers and artistic opulence. Ready to step in?"

Mangroves are nature's coastal guardians. With their arching and salt-filtering roots, they thrive where few trees can—anchored in brackish water, enduring tides and shifting sands. They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals. Their tangled root systems not only stabilise sediment but also provide shelter for juvenile fish, crabs and birds."

Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration.

Spanning over 950 square kilometres, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats."

The moon landing was the result of US President John F. Kennedy's bold 1961 goal to send a man to the moon and return him safely before the decade's end. Apollo 11 launched from Kennedy Space Centre, Florida, on July 16, 1969, reaching lunar orbit by July 19.

Every corner of the Bahamas is a shade card of blue, but the most captivating of all are the turquoise waters that surround the islands. The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here. Whether you're snorkelling among coral reefs, watching fireworks from a beachfront or cruising the Exuma Cays under the golden sun, the sea glows with a brilliance that feels almost magical."

        "description": "If you're looking for a scent-sational summer trip, follow your nose to the Plateau de Valensole in Provence, France. From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 500 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 800 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation. Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail, and let your summer bloom with lavender memories."

They are symbols of ocean health, which is why Shark Awareness Day draws attention to these apex predators that help maintain balance in marine ecosystems. Protecting sharks means preserving the health of entire ocean environments—and ultimately, securing a sustainable future for all life. Take the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans. Blue sharks are famous for their epic migrations—some travel from New England to South America, guided by seasonal changes, food availability and favourable environmental conditions."

From Stone Age tools to the minerals powering modern civilisation, rocks have been essential throughout our journey. International Rock Day celebrates this enduring impact, inviting us to explore the science of rocks, admire their natural beauty and recognise the rich variety they add to our world. If you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula. Unlike Iceland's famous black sand beaches, this cove's shore is strewn with large, smooth pebbles, while its fiery volcanic past still reveals itself in the towering cliffs. Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns."

With 8.2 billion people and counting, World Population Day highlights how that growth affects cities, food and the future. First observed in 1989, the day focuses on how unchecked population growth affects sustainability. The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability."

This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection."

The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force.

        "description": "In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village met unexpected resistance. Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience. It reminds us that Pride began with bricks, not branding. So, as rainbow flags wave each June, remember the power of resistance—and that the first Pride was a riot with a cause."

        "description": "Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around. The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required."

This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be around 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide."

The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore."

What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, United States, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognised as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971."

Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town).

Today's image captures a tender moment between a Masai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. The Masai giraffe is easily recognised by its jagged, irregular spots and inhabits various regions across eastern Africa. It is the largest giraffe species and the tallest land animal on Earth. Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is its long neck, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of its total height."

Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognising these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection. There are seven species of sea turtles gliding through the world's oceans: green, loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley and flatback. Most of them are either endangered or vulnerable."

Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane. She sought to pay tribute to her father, a Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads."

The unique shape of this tiny island, sculpted by nature, makes it truly special. At its heart lies an almost perfectly circular lagoon, linked to the sea by a narrow channel called Boquete. Since the opening faces north toward São Miguel, it shields the lagoon from ocean waves and forms a calm natural harbour with a sandy beach."

Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

These long-legged locals, the greater flamingos, bring a splash of pink to Namibia's windswept Atlantic coast. These birds are the largest of their kind, and they're not shy about showing off. Towering over 120 centimetres tall with spoon-shaped bills and stilt-like legs, they're easy to spot. That bubblegum pink hue? That's all diet. Flamingos feed on algae, crustaceans and tiny invertebrates packed with carotenoids—the same pigments that make carrots orange. The more they eat, the pinker they get. In other words, they're what they eat, right down to the blush. In the air, flamingos are sleek flyers, cruising long distances in a V-formation. Their migration habits are still being studied, but it's clear they go where the wetlands flow—from inland salt pans to coastal sanctuaries, always in search of food and safe nesting zones."

Everglades National Park, located in Florida, is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States, spanning more than 6,000 square kilometres. It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. The park also plays a crucial role in water conservation and flood control, as its wetlands serve as natural filters and buffers against storms."

Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch close to 2 kilometres, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 250 metres into the sky—perfect for rock climbing. Here, the waters are shallow at first, before deepening into crystal-clear depths ideal for snorkelling, diving and fishing. In the local Nuoro dialect, the word for 'Luna,' meaning 'moon', is rendered as 'elune,' a name that perfectly captures the essence of this enchanting cove. Adding to the mystique, the beach's crescent shape echoes its lunar inspiration. For centuries, shepherds from the village of Baunei would embark on an eight-hour walk to reach this secluded spot, considering it a journey as far as the moon itself."

Parts of the loop are accessible by wheelchair and pram. The landscape is shaped by the last inland ice that melted around 10,000 years ago, leaving behind moraine (accumulation of unconsolidated debris) and glacial river sand. The most common trees in the park are pines, but various shrubs can also be found, such as dwarf birch, crowberry and wild rosemary."

That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, United States. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers praised it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up with it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s. The West, Middle and East prongs come together to form a system that cuts through the Smokies and flows into the Pigeon River. Trails like the Gatlinburg Trail run alongside the river, offering flat paths with water views and shady rest spots. Some hikes, like the Ramsey Cascades trail, follow the river deeper into the park and reward you with impressive waterfalls."

As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport and even defence. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferryboats and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is more than 20 metres long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools were also used by large numbers of World War II troops who camped nearby. They are free, open year-round and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

It is home to the country's highest peaks, including Galdhøpiggen, the highest in Northern Europe at more than 2,400 metres. The name 'Jotunheimen' translates to 'Home of the Giants,' a nod to its dramatic terrain and Norse mythology. The park shelters red foxes, Arctic foxes, lemmings and red deer, while its flora includes hardy alpine species adapted to extreme conditions. Flowing through the park, the Gjende lake is famous for its striking green colour, caused by glacial sediments. Stretching about 17 kilometres in length and less than a kilometre at its widest point, the lake sits at around 1,100 metres above sea level. It's the launch point for the famous Besseggen hike—which attracts thousands each year—made famous by Henrik Ibsen's play 'Peer Gynt.'"

India is one of the world's most biodiverse countries, home to nearly 10% of global species. Its ecological wealth is deeply woven into its culture, shaped over thousands of years. But this delicate balance is under threat—from rising populations and climate change to weak enforcement of environmental laws. As species edge toward extinction, it's not just the natural food chain that suffers, but also the livelihoods and traditions of millions who rely on this biodiversity to sustain their way of life."

Centuries later, tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world (after water). Today is International Tea Day, a global nod to this timeless beverage, established by the United Nations to recognise tea's role in reducing poverty and supporting sustainable development. It's a day to honour both the drink and the people who are part of this industry."

Alongside butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honours these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science."

Over 31-kilometre Mount Hamilton Road is part of State Route 130. It is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. The road, built in 1875-76, was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. At the summit, standing at over 1,200 metres, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada on a clear day."

This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications. International Museum Day, celebrated annually on May 18, aims to raise awareness about the importance of museums in cultural exchange, enrichment and mutual understanding. Since its inception in 1977, the event has grown to include over 37,000 museums across 158 countries."

Spanning over 500 square kilometres, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Today, the lagoon is still central to local life, supporting fishing, tourism and even sustainable aquaculture. It's connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets and is famous for 'acqua alta,' or 'high water,' when tides flood parts of Venice. From ancient refuge to modern marvel, the Venetian Lagoon is a reflection of how people and nature can shape a place together."

Step closer, and you'll discover a design that is brilliantly functional. Thanks to over 900 openings, the air flows freely, creating a constant, cooling breeze. Hence, the name translates to 'Palace of the Winds.' In 1799, Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, commissioned the creation of this remarkable structure. The architect behind its design was Lal Chand Ustad."

The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during World Wars I and II. Each of its four clock faces spans more than 6 metres, with the minute hands measuring over 4 metres. At more than 90 metre tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster, home to the UK Parliament."

This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in Sulcis-Iglesiente has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. In 1924, Italian engineer Cesare Vecelli revolutionised ore transport in the region. He designed Porto Flavia as a system of tunnels and silos carved into a limestone cliff, allowing ore to be loaded directly onto cargo ships. The port, named after Vecelli's daughter, Flavia, remained in use until mining declined in the mid-20th century."

Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,400 metres tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today."

Just as the last sakura (cherry blossom) petals drift away, Tokyo's gardens start gearing up for their next big show: the iris bloom. Featured here is an iris garden in Tokyo. The iris is a flowering plant genus that has 310 recognised species, known for their bold and beautiful blossoms. The genus is named after the Greek word 'îris', meaning 'rainbow,' which is also the name of the Greek goddess of rainbows. During the Edo Period (1603-1867), a fascination with breeding Japanese irises led to an explosion of new varieties. Today, there are over 2,000 types, which are planted in March and nurtured by tsuyu, Japan's rainy season. These vibrant flowers make their grand entrance in early June, marking the start of summer."

Featured in today's image, it is the second-largest self-supported marble dome in the world. This dome is built in three layers, each serving a different purpose. The outermost layer, made of Georgia marble, holds itself up by sheer weight alone. Inside, a brick-and-steel cone adds support and helps drain water to withstand Minnesota's harsh winters. The innermost layer is the beautifully decorated dome visible from the rotunda. Resting at its base, twelve marble eagles stand alongside the surrounding columns. Crowning the structure is an elegant stone lantern, topped with a gleaming gold-leaf-covered finial globe."

With over 200 species found in diverse habitats, these reptiles don't change colour to match their background.

Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment."

        "description": "In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily. This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is over 40 centimetres tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands. The Victoria, or giant water lily, belongs to the genus of aquatic herbs, including species like Victoria amazonica and Victoria boliviana, which can boast leaves more than 3 metres in diameter. The Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, is a sanctuary for wildlife and offers an extraordinary glimpse into the natural world."

While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and lush moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes despite the rugged terrain. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons."

This geothermal marvel is fuelled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface.

The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, an American high school student, in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is in the United States, in Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, which is an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder."

Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three.

        "description": "New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest! Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants."

Then, on April 12, 1961, one man left the planet and changed history forever. That morning, Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin climbed into a small, spherical spacecraft named Vostok 1. The countdown began. The engines ignited. As the rocket roared toward the sky, he called out, 'Poyekhali!'—'Let's go!' And just like that, Earth had its first space traveller."

These beauties arrived in the country in the late 16th century, brought from the Ottoman Empire. By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

Siblings Day is here—a day to appreciate the ones who stole your toys, tattled on you and yet somehow remain your biggest supporters. Siblings Day has gained recognition across several countries. The idea came from Claudia Evart, who established the day in memory of her late siblings. In India, the bond between siblings is celebrated each year through Raksha Bandhan, a tradition where sisters tie a rakhi—a sacred thread—around their brother's wrist. This heartfelt gesture symbolises love, protection and the deep connection shared between siblings."

As North America's largest rodents, they can grow not more than 1 metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers. So, take a moment to appreciate these incredible ecosystem engineers and their hardworking, tree-chomping ways. Who knew a furry little architect could have such a big impact on nature?"

From leaping through waves to chatting in clicks and whistles, dolphins are all about social life. Take the Atlantic spotted dolphin—featured here—known for the spots on its body, which multiply and become denser with age. They are highly social creatures, often forming dynamic groups of 5–15 individuals, sometimes mingling with common bottlenose dolphins. Known for their speed and agility, they frequently engage in bow-riding and perform long, shallow leaps across the water. These dolphins are also skilled nocturnal hunters, working together to corral their prey—primarily small fish, benthic invertebrates and squid. When confronting other species, they tend to use physical tactics like biting and chasing, whereas within their own groups, they rely more on visual displays to assert dominance."

Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea."

Determined to honour the emperor's legacy, Bega Begum entrusted Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas with bringing her vision to reality. However, he passed away before the project's completion, leaving his son, Sayyid Muhammad ibn Mirak Ghiyath Ud Din, to carry forward his work. Construction began in 1565, nine years after Humayun's passing, and was completed in 1572."

Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 2 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species."

These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. There are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get."

Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?"

        "description": "Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara deserts. These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes more than 60 kilometres in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes."

Notable formations such as Wilson Mountain, Seven Sacred Pools and Cathedral Rock offer iconic views.

They play a crucial role in their bamboo forest ecosystem by dispersing seeds and fostering new vegetation growth, which benefits countless plants and animals. Once classified as 'endangered,' their conservation status was upgraded to 'vulnerable' in 2016, thanks to dedicated efforts such as breeding programmes, reforestation initiatives and habitat preservation. Despite this progress, fewer than 2,000 pandas remain in the wild, primarily due to habitat loss caused by deforestation and farming. Efforts to protect bamboo forests and improve breeding programmes are vital to their survival. While pandas may be cute and cuddly, they're also environmental heroes. Their conservation helps preserve biodiversity in their natural habitats. Let's work together to protect these gentle giants!"

The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life."

This unique celebration takes place in the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon in Uttar Pradesh. It is observed the day after Laddu Holi, where women playfully shower men with laddoos. Rooted in the legend of Radha and Krishna, this festival brings an age-old tale to life. As the story goes, Lord Krishna, hailing from Nandgaon and regarded as the son-in-law of Vrishabhanu, wished to drench his beloved Radha and her friends in colours. However, when he and his companions arrived in Barsana, they were met with playful resistance—Radha and her friends chased them away with sticks. This lively tradition continues to this day during Holi."

Researchers believe that both Galápagos land iguanas and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor that likely rafted from Central or South America.

Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. Today, after multiple restorations, the castle welcomes visitors eager to uncover its history. It also stands as an example of French Renaissance architecture."

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh more than 10 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of over 30 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."

And then there's Cheow Lan Lake—a reservoir created for hydropower in 1982 when the Rajjaprabha Dam was built. Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016."

This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa."

Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects. Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley. Just a two-hour drive from Sydney, this region is home to getaway cabins, wineries and the Megalong Valley Tearooms, a charming retreat where you can enjoy freshly baked scones paired with local jams."

Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead. Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 3,048 metres above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students."

They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. It is important that we reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators."

One of the highest Shiva temples in the world, Tungnath is perched high in the Himalayas at 3,680 metres. This sacred site, in Uttarakhand's Rudraprayag district, is the loftiest of the five Panch Kedar temples, and sits just below the majestic Chandrashila peak."

The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,500 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern."

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking structure more than 190 metres tall that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

In Canada, these animals are primarily found in Alberta, with the prairies and parklands around the city of Red Deer offering an ideal habitat for them. The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength."

        "description": "At Lake Tyrrell, southern Australia, the sky meets the Earth in a dazzling display. The state of Victoria's largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate change caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in over 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 180 square kilometres, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

Vaishali also played a starring role in Buddhism, as it was here that Gautama Buddha delivered his final sermon before attaining parinirvana around 483 BCE."

This masterpiece of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is over 15 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. Caves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side."

It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 300 metres above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons. Lake Powell, spanning across Utah and Arizona, attracts around 3 million visitors every year."

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material. China, Australia, India and Iran are home to some of the largest modern sheep flocks, catering to both domestic demands and international markets for wool and mutton."

While it's famous for its port wine (cheers to that!), there's so much more to discover in the Portuguese city of Porto. As you walk through its streets, you'll notice façades adorned with azulejos—painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework found in Portugal and Spain—historic churches like São Francisco, and the iconic Dom Luís I Bridge, which spans the Douro River, which runs through the city."

Today's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip."

Its iconic Moorish castle ruins and the 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Fun fact: Many people thought the name Zahara de la Sierra came from azahar, the Arabic word for citrus blossom. However, studies suggest it actually comes from sahra, which means wild or barren land, reflecting the rocky hill where the village is located. As part of Andalusia's famous Route of the White Villages, Zahara de la Sierra promises unforgettable experiences in one of Spain's most beautiful corners."

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of over 1.5 metres. The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story."

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored."

Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. According to local Māori legends, the Moeraki Boulders are remnants of eel baskets, calabashes and kūmara that washed ashore from the wreck of Āraiteuru, a great sailing canoe."

It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

These beautifully designed tanks, with their perfectly laid stone steps, were crafted to make access to the water easy. These tanks have deep cultural significance and are highly revered. Historically, Pushkaranis were built for ritualistic temple practices or as royal amenities during the Vijayanagara Empire. In Hampi, almost every grand temple has one tank, serving both spiritual and functional purposes. The Pushkarani in front of the Sri Krishna Temple, seen in today's image, is one of the most elegant and accessible tanks here."

Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and more than 80 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located over 270 kilometres north of Hanoi, the waterfalls have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall. Even with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path. Mass tourism hasn't caught up yet, and on most weekdays, you'll find only a handful of visitors—just you, the locals and the sound of cascading water."

While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings' and beyond. For today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England."

This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840, when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. The structure is divided into three sections: the base has detailed carvings that teach moral lessons; the middle level consists of five square terraces with reliefs depicting daily life and historical events; and the upper levels are three circular platforms with 72 stupas—mound-like structures containing Buddha statues."

Legend has it, a beautiful princess would take a bath here and then drink sweetened milk from a golden jug. One day she saw a handsome prince watching her. To protect her modesty, she poured the milk, forming a white curtain as a shield. According to the tale, the milk continues to flow down the mountains as a tribute to her grace and virtue. This gem in the Western Ghats marks the journey of the Mandovi River as it falls toward Panaji and finally meets the Arabian Sea. During the dry season, the falls might seem unassuming, but with the arrival of the monsoon, they transform into a magnificent cascade of thundering water."

The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

The tradition evolved into a day for charitable giving to the less fortunate. Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches. However, December 26th in India is marked by a more somber remembrance—the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which is why the disaster is often referred to as the 'Boxing Day Tsunami.'"

Beyond its spiritual roots, Christmas also lights up the season with beloved customs—decorating trees, carolling and eagerly awaiting Santa's arrival. Recognised as a state holiday in India, Christmas is celebrated as a secular occasion. For Christians, particularly Catholics, attending Midnight Mass is a key tradition. Many Christian households adorn their homes with cribs, trees and brightly lit stars symbolising the Bethlehem star. They also share sweets and cakes with neighbours. In northern and north-western regions, it's known as Bada Din (Big Day), and some communities mark the occasion by planting trees."

The lower stonework boasts delicate floral carvings from the Gupta era, while its walls feature finely detailed depictions of humans, birds and inscriptions in the ancient Brahmi script. Although the stupa has been expanded six times over the centuries, the upper section remains unfinished. Standing before it, one can't help but marvel at the stories it holds."

Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here. Tchaikovsky's score is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument with a bell-like tone, which perfectly captures the fairy-tale atmosphere."

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

The Advent season here creates a magical atmosphere, making it a truly unforgettable time to visit this city. Seen on the hill in today's image is the Hohensalzburg Fortress, home to the popular Fortress Advent market, brimming with holiday cheer. The streets come alive with parades featuring Krampus and Perchten, unsettling figures central to Austria's cherished folk traditions. When these fearsome characters storm down the streets, half dancing, half stomping, they leave everyone watching with chills. These parades are unlike anything else and are as much a part of Salzburg's Christmas spirit as the soul-soothing Advent Singing."

Well, legend has it that Lake Misurina, pictured here, in Italy's Dolomites, was born from the sorrow of a giant named Sorapis. At more than 1,700 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than two kilometres. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni."

With its long, tapered tail and a small head resembling a hawk, the northern hawk-owl is a striking sight. These owls don't migrate, so they can be spotted year-round. However, in winter they may move south from Canada into the northern United States to find food when it's scarce in their regular territory."

The history of the poinsettia can be traced back to ancient civilisations. The Aztecs, who called it cuetlaxóchitl, used it to make a reddish-purple dye and to treat fevers. But the plant's association with Christmas has roots in Mexican tradition, where it's known as 'la flor de Nochebuena' or 'Holy Night flower.' According to legend, a young girl, unable to afford a gift for Baby Jesus, was inspired to offer humble weeds, which miraculously transformed into the vibrant poinsettias we know today."

They can live up to 28 years in the wild, making them some of the longest-living land mammals of their size in South America. Guanacos are one of the continent's largest land animals today, sharing their megafauna status with South American giants like tapirs, marsh deer and jaguars. Guanacos munch on grasses, shrubs and even cacti, using a fascinating digestive process like, but distinct from, ruminants."

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

While these towers can be found in many places, today's image showcases them at Mono Lake in Mono County, California, United States. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981 by the California State Legislature."

        "description": "Welcome to the coastal town of Murdeshwar in Karnataka's North Canara district, right along the Laccadive Sea. The town's star attraction is the magnificent Murudeshwara temple, perched atop Kanduka Hill, seen in today's image. Built in 2008, this temple is constructed in the classic Dravidian architectural style and features Chalukya and Kadamba sculptures. It houses a lift that gives visitors a breathtaking view of the towering 37-metre Shiva statue, which is the third tallest in the world. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the primary deity here, Sri Mridesa Linga, also known as Murudeshwara, is believed to be a fragment of the original Atma Linga. It rests about 60 centimetres below the ground. Flanked by two life-sized concrete elephants, the temple complex, including the impressive 20-storey, over 60-metre-tall Raja Gopura, is among the tallest in the region—truly a sight to behold!"

The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the over 200-kilometre-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the 'Statue of Equality' (Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial) in Mumbai, he made an announcement that this day would henceforth be celebrated as 'Constitution Day.' Historically, the day marks the momentous adoption of our constitution, which started on 26 November in 1949. This document establishes the framework that outlines the fundamental political code, structures, procedures, powers and responsibilities of government institutions. It also articulates the fundamental rights, directive principles and duties of citizens."

They're also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 60 kilometres per hour. Giraffes are common in east Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands and reserves."

Featured here is a pair of African lion cubs sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa. Typically born in litters of one to four, they are tucked away in a secluded den for safety. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride. This isn't just a casual interaction—it's an important moment for them to socialise and find their place in the group. During this time, they learn how to behave within the pride, which helps shape their roles as they grow up. After they hit six months, they begin to accompany adults on hunting trips, learning essential skills and tricks of the trade through real-life adventures."

From there, they were spread to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then further afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood and fruit for millennia. The southern region of Puglia in Italy, seen here, has an estimated 60 million olive trees and produces about 40% of the country's olive oil. The region has been producing olives for centuries. The oldest olive tree in Puglia, and one of the oldest in Italy, is thought to be almost 4,000 years old."

This park is home to several unique flowering plants, as well as Australian fur seals and little penguins. Dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite are a key feature of this area. The Tasmans Arch in today's image is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock."

The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

Every star you see is part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which gets its name from the way it appears as a creamy band of light in the darkest skies. In today's image, you can see this cosmic beauty glowing over Aït Benhaddou, a historic ksar—a kind of fortified village—in the Ouarzazate province of Morocco. This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh. Perched on a hillside by the Ounila River, this village is a cluster of buildings encircled by a protective wall, complete with towers and a gate."

The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

These canines, seen in British Columbia in today's image, thrive in this ecosystem, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the grey wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

This village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described it as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia. While the bison has made a heroic recovery, the story isn't over. These animals still face challenges, including habitat loss and hunting."

Regardless of the countless narratives and reasons behind the festivities, the central theme remains the triumph of good over evil. For many, Diwali is a homage to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, who is thought to be guided into the homes of devotees by the glow of lights and lamps. The day isn't just about lights and legends—it's also a time for enjoying moments with loved ones, exchanging gifts and sweets, indulging in delicious feasts and dressing up in new outfits. Observed worldwide, its largest celebrations outside of India occur in Leicester, United Kingdom."

When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back.

        "description": "At the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, take a left underneath the imposing Catholic church. Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings."

In today's image, we're transported to the George L. Smith State Park, which spans 6.61 square kilometres in Emanuel County, Georgia. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.6-square-kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the US. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

        "description": "Let's go on a journey to one of the most captivating spots in ancient Egypt—Dendera. Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius. This temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution. Isn't it amazing how much history one place can hold?"

It's one of Central Park's most photographed seasons and autumn in the park has provided iconic backdrops for movies like 'When Harry Met Sally…' and 'Hair.' Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which light from sunrises and sunsets hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

The palace grounds come to life with cultural performances showcasing Karnataka's heritage of dance, music and art. The origins of the festival remain a mystery, but historical evidence points to its celebration during the 14th-15th century by the Vijayanagara kings. Known as Mahanavami at the time, the festival held great significance in the empire."

Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilisation inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was a well-known lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist. He is celebrated for his use of nonviolent resistance to spearhead India's successful struggle for independence from British rule. This day is globally recognised as the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations. Gandhi Jayanti is marked by prayer services and tributes throughout the country, with special observances at Raj Ghat in New Delhi, the site of his cremation."

Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

If you're a walrus like the ones in today's image, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 3-metres long and weigh more than 1,179 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species."

Known for their egalitarian and informal nature, Bavarians are famously sociable, a trait that's on full display during the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, attracting about six million visitors each year. This sociability is also evident in Bavaria's iconic beer gardens, where patrons are welcome to bring their own food while enjoying beer exclusively from the hosting brewery."

The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects."

The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

Later freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar popularised it in Maharashtra in 1893. This move aimed to foster a 'Hindu nationalist identity' and resist British colonial rule."

The lower stretches of the river, known as the Tideway, extend up to Teddington Lock, reflecting its extensive tidal reach. From Oxford to its estuary, the river descends 55 metres. Although the Thames flows through some of the drier regions of mainland Britain and is heavily tapped for drinking water, its discharge is relatively low compared to its size."

Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador. Although eruptions ceased some 11 millennia ago, the area is still considered seismically active. In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona more than 80 kilometres away. Today, it's a serene haven for trekkers, akin to the trails of the Western Ghats, inviting enthusiasts to explore volcanic vistas untouched by time."

This creature, the largest in the alligator family, can grow to more than 6 metres and tip the scales at upwards of 450 kilograms. Their dark scales are a masterstroke of camouflage, giving them an edge in hunting a variety of aquatic and terrestrial prey. Their role extends beyond predation, however. They indirectly protect our agricultural interests by maintaining balance within their ecosystem, preventing overpopulation of species such as piranhas and capybaras, which can affect local agriculture and livestock."

It's also one of the few places outside the Galápagos Islands where red-footed boobies are found. A wide variety of marine wildlife is in and around the atoll, including green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles and the mighty coconut crab, the world's largest land invertebrate."

This fort once housed a vault that safeguarded some of the world's most famous gems, including the legendary Koh-i-Noor and Hope diamonds. The origins of the fort date back to the 11th century when it was first established as a modest mud fort by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire. It's also believed that the Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva, who reigned from 1199 to 1262, constructed a stone outpost on the hilltop to protect the empire's western frontier."

It spans more than 354 square kilometres, where silence speaks through the rustling leaves and trickling streams. This area, a cornerstone of Maine's timber industry, now breathes tranquillity instead of timber clamour. Roxanne Quimby and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations. Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx and numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing."

Despite their comical moniker derived from 'bobo,' Spanish for 'fool,' due to their land-bound awkwardness, these birds are graceful in flight and a marvel to behold. The Galápagos, much like India's very own Andaman and Nicobar Islands, boasts a unique tapestry of biodiversity. Step into this arena of natural wonders where the Nazca booby thrives amidst the cliffs and seas. So, dare to answer the call of the wild?"

The Teton Range, named 'les trois tétons' by French explorers, towers over the landscape with its jagged peaks that defy time itself. At about 16 kilometres from Yellowstone National Park, these peaks, part of a mountain range less than 10 million years old, continue to captivate with their youthful defiance against erosion. Encompassing thriving ecosystems, the park is a sanctuary for grizzly bears, wolves and the flight of bald eagles. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over the Jackson Hole valley and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold."

Built in 1919, the Alfanzina lighthouse shines out over the ocean to help ships navigate the dangerous waters that surround the area. A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also became a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. Lighthouses have been keeping sailors safe almost as long as humans have been sailing the seas. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships have often been used. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit."

The origins of these rides can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as the  White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—buckle up, take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

This day commemorates the transfer of legislative sovereignty from the British crown to the Indian Constituent Assembly. Our first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national flag at the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi on August 15, 1947. Since then, it has become a tradition for the sitting prime minister to raise the flag and deliver a national address on Independence Day. Over time, the focus of the celebration has shifted from solely nationalism to a broader appreciation of Indian culture and heritage. The Indian diaspora also celebrates this day worldwide, with parades and events, especially in areas with significant Indian populations. In New York and other US cities, it has come to be recognised as 'India Day.' Independence Day is not just a reminder of our country's journey towards independence but also the ongoing commitment to build a brighter future for all."
