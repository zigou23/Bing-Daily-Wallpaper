        "description": "Today, we are in a wildlife-packed wonderland with rainforests older than the Amazon—Khao Sok National Park in Surat Thani province, southern Thailand. Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. And then there's Cheow Lan Lake—a reservoir created for hydropower in 1982 when the Rajjaprabha Dam was built. Over time, the lake transformed the landscape into something you'd think was straight out of a movie, as featured in today's image. The dam, originally known as the 'Cheow Lan Project,' was later renamed Rajjaprabha, meaning 'light of the kingdom,' a tribute to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 to 2016."

This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa."

Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects. Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley. Just a two-hour drive from Sydney, this region is home to getaway cabins, wineries and the Megalong Valley Tearooms, a charming retreat where you can enjoy freshly baked scones paired with local jams."

Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead. Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 3,048 metres above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students."

They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. It is important that we reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators."

One of the highest Shiva temples in the world, Tungnath is perched high in the Himalayas at 3,680 metres. This sacred site, in Uttarakhand's Rudraprayag district, is the loftiest of the five Panch Kedar temples, and sits just below the majestic Chandrashila peak."

The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,500 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern."

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking structure more than 190 metres tall that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

In Canada, these animals are primarily found in Alberta, with the prairies and parklands around the city of Red Deer offering an ideal habitat for them. The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength."

A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."

This day has its origins in the story of Saint Valentine, a Roman Christian who, according to legend, performed marriages for Christian soldiers who were forbidden from marrying. Just like the human lovebirds who will be celebrating today, nature also has its own romantics."

Over time, climate change caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in over 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 180 square kilometres, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

This masterpiece of early Buddhist art is near Datong in Shanxi province, northeastern China. Carved into sandstone cliffs over 1,500 years ago during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534/535 CE), the grottoes contain 254 caves. The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is over 15 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. Caves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao. While you're there, be sure to explore Cave 20's seated Buddha idol in a meditation posture, with a standing attendant Buddha on one side."

Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 300 metres above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons.

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material. China, Australia, India and Iran are home to some of the largest modern sheep flocks, catering to both domestic demands and international markets for wool and mutton."

In 1950, on this day, India adopted its Constitution, officially becoming a sovereign republic. The President of India delivers an address to the nation on the eve of Republic Day. On the day itself, he raises the national flag in New Delhi, while Governors and Lieutenant Governors perform flag-hoisting ceremonies in their respective states and union territories."

Today's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip."

Its iconic Moorish castle ruins and the 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress.

However, studies suggest it actually comes from sahra, which means wild or barren land, reflecting the rocky hill where the village is located. As part of Andalusia's famous Route of the White Villages, Zahara de la Sierra promises unforgettable experiences in one of Spain's most beautiful corners."

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of over 1.5 metres. The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story."

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored."

Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. According to local Māori legends, the Moeraki Boulders are remnants of eel baskets, calabashes and kūmara that washed ashore from the wreck of Āraiteuru, a great sailing canoe."

        "description": "In the Italian province of Ravenna lies the Basilica of San Francesco, recognised for its beauty and historical significance. This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided into two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

In Hampi, almost every grand temple has one tank, serving both spiritual and functional purposes. The Pushkarani in front of the Sri Krishna Temple, seen in today's image, is one of the most elegant and accessible tanks here."

Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and more than 80 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located over 270 kilometres north of Hanoi, the waterfalls have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall. Even with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path. Mass tourism hasn't caught up yet, and on most weekdays, you'll find only a handful of visitors—just you, the locals and the sound of cascading water."

For today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England."

This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840, when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. The structure is divided into three sections: the base has detailed carvings that teach moral lessons; the middle level consists of five square terraces with reliefs depicting daily life and historical events; and the upper levels are three circular platforms with 72 stupas—mound-like structures containing Buddha statues."

Legend has it, a beautiful princess would take a bath here and then drink sweetened milk from a golden jug. One day she saw a handsome prince watching her. To protect her modesty, she poured the milk, forming a white curtain as a shield. According to the tale, the milk continues to flow down the mountains as a tribute to her grace and virtue. This gem in the Western Ghats marks the journey of the Mandovi River as it falls toward Panaji and finally meets the Arabian Sea. During the dry season, the falls might seem unassuming, but with the arrival of the monsoon, they transform into a magnificent cascade of thundering water."

The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches. However, December 26th in India is marked by a more somber remembrance—the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which is why the disaster is often referred to as the 'Boxing Day Tsunami.'"

Beyond its spiritual roots, Christmas also lights up the season with beloved customs—decorating trees, carolling and eagerly awaiting Santa's arrival. Recognised as a state holiday in India, Christmas is celebrated as a secular occasion. For Christians, particularly Catholics, attending Midnight Mass is a key tradition. Many Christian households adorn their homes with cribs, trees and brightly lit stars symbolising the Bethlehem star. They also share sweets and cakes with neighbours. In northern and north-western regions, it's known as Bada Din (Big Day), and some communities mark the occasion by planting trees."

The lower stonework boasts delicate floral carvings from the Gupta era, while its walls feature finely detailed depictions of humans, birds and inscriptions in the ancient Brahmi script. Although the stupa has been expanded six times over the centuries, the upper section remains unfinished. Standing before it, one can't help but marvel at the stories it holds."

Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

        "description": "Every holiday season, as snow begins to fall and Christmas lights twinkle in the night, the story of 'The Nutcracker' comes to life on stages around the world. Written by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1892, this beloved ballet is based on E.T.A. Hoffmann's fairy tale 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.' Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here. Tchaikovsky's score is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument with a bell-like tone, which perfectly captures the fairy-tale atmosphere."

One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

The streets come alive with parades featuring Krampus and Perchten, unsettling figures central to Austria's cherished folk traditions. When these fearsome characters storm down the streets, half dancing, half stomping, they leave everyone watching with chills. These parades are unlike anything else and are as much a part of Salzburg's Christmas spirit as the soul-soothing Advent Singing."

At more than 1,700 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than two kilometres. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni."

With its long, tapered tail and a small head resembling a hawk, the northern hawk-owl is a striking sight. These owls don't migrate, so they can be spotted year-round.

But the plant's association with Christmas has roots in Mexican tradition, where it's known as 'la flor de Nochebuena' or 'Holy Night flower.' According to legend, a young girl, unable to afford a gift for Baby Jesus, was inspired to offer humble weeds, which miraculously transformed into the vibrant poinsettias we know today."

They can live up to 28 years in the wild, making them some of the longest-living land mammals of their size in South America. Guanacos are one of the continent's largest land animals today, sharing their megafauna status with South American giants like tapirs, marsh deer and jaguars. Guanacos munch on grasses, shrubs and even cacti, using a fascinating digestive process like, but distinct from, ruminants."

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

While these towers can be found in many places, today's image showcases them at Mono Lake in Mono County, California, United States. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981 by the California State Legislature."

        "description": "A tidal marvel and a slice of medieval life all rolled into one rocky outcrop—welcome to Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy, northern France. The story of this 'Wonder of the West' goes back to the early 8th century, when Archangel Michael was said to have appeared to the bishop of Avranches in a vision. The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims and invaders alike."

The town's star attraction is the magnificent Murudeshwara temple, perched atop Kanduka Hill, seen in today's image. Built in 2008, this temple is constructed in the classic Dravidian architectural style and features Chalukya and Kadamba sculptures. It houses a lift that gives visitors a breathtaking view of the towering 37-metre Shiva statue, which is the third tallest in the world. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the primary deity here, Sri Mridesa Linga, also known as Murudeshwara, is believed to be a fragment of the original Atma Linga. It rests about 60 centimetres below the ground. Flanked by two life-sized concrete elephants, the temple complex, including the impressive 20-storey, over 60-metre-tall Raja Gopura, is among the tallest in the region—truly a sight to behold!"

The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the 'Statue of Equality' (Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial) in Mumbai, he made an announcement that this day would henceforth be celebrated as 'Constitution Day.' Historically, the day marks the momentous adoption of our constitution, which started on 26 November in 1949. This document establishes the framework that outlines the fundamental political code, structures, procedures, powers and responsibilities of government institutions. It also articulates the fundamental rights, directive principles and duties of citizens."

Featured here is a pair of African lion cubs sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa. Typically born in litters of one to four, they are tucked away in a secluded den for safety. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride. This isn't just a casual interaction—it's an important moment for them to socialise and find their place in the group. During this time, they learn how to behave within the pride, which helps shape their roles as they grow up. After they hit six months, they begin to accompany adults on hunting trips, learning essential skills and tricks of the trade through real-life adventures."

From there, they were spread to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then further afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood and fruit for millennia. The southern region of Puglia in Italy, seen here, has an estimated 60 million olive trees and produces about 40% of the country's olive oil. The region has been producing olives for centuries. The oldest olive tree in Puglia, and one of the oldest in Italy, is thought to be almost 4,000 years old."

This park is home to several unique flowering plants, as well as Australian fur seals and little penguins. Dramatic cliffs and distinctive columns of dolerite are a key feature of this area. The Tasmans Arch in today's image is a standout example. Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock."

The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

        "description": "Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies? If you have, they may have been Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

In today's image, you can see this cosmic beauty glowing over Aït Benhaddou, a historic ksar—a kind of fortified village—in the Ouarzazate province of Morocco. This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh. Perched on a hillside by the Ounila River, this village is a cluster of buildings encircled by a protective wall, complete with towers and a gate."

The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

These canines, seen in British Columbia in today's image, thrive in this ecosystem, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the grey wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

This village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described it as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia. While the bison has made a heroic recovery, the story isn't over. These animals still face challenges, including habitat loss and hunting."

Regardless of the countless narratives and reasons behind the festivities, the central theme remains the triumph of good over evil. For many, Diwali is a homage to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, who is thought to be guided into the homes of devotees by the glow of lights and lamps. The day isn't just about lights and legends—it's also a time for enjoying moments with loved ones, exchanging gifts and sweets, indulging in delicious feasts and dressing up in new outfits. Observed worldwide, its largest celebrations outside of India occur in Leicester, United Kingdom."

When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings."

In today's image, we're transported to the George L. Smith State Park, which spans 6.61 square kilometres in Emanuel County, Georgia. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.6-square-kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the US. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

        "description": "Let's go on a journey to one of the most captivating spots in ancient Egypt—Dendera. Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius. This temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution. Isn't it amazing how much history one place can hold?"

It's one of Central Park's most photographed seasons and autumn in the park has provided iconic backdrops for movies like 'When Harry Met Sally…' and 'Hair.' Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which light from sunrises and sunsets hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

The palace grounds come to life with cultural performances showcasing Karnataka's heritage of dance, music and art. The origins of the festival remain a mystery, but historical evidence points to its celebration during the 14th-15th century by the Vijayanagara kings. Known as Mahanavami at the time, the festival held great significance in the empire."

The Etruscan civilisation inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was a well-known lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist. He is celebrated for his use of nonviolent resistance to spearhead India's successful struggle for independence from British rule. This day is globally recognised as the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations. Gandhi Jayanti is marked by prayer services and tributes throughout the country, with special observances at Raj Ghat in New Delhi, the site of his cremation."

To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 3-metres long and weigh more than 1,179 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species."

Known for their egalitarian and informal nature, Bavarians are famously sociable, a trait that's on full display during the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, attracting about six million visitors each year. This sociability is also evident in Bavaria's iconic beer gardens, where patrons are welcome to bring their own food while enjoying beer exclusively from the hosting brewery."

The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects."

Famous for its iconic moai statues, this stunning island is a treasure trove of breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Experts are divided on the timeline of the Polynesians' arrival, though many researchers suggest that it occurred around the 8th century. Take in the mesmerising sunrise featured in today's image and explore the striking volcanic craters and lush, grassy plains where the imposing statues stand. The World Heritage property of Easter Island spans more than 68 square kilometres, including four nearby islets."

The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

Later freedom fighter Bal Gangadhar popularised it in Maharashtra in 1893. This move aimed to foster a 'Hindu nationalist identity' and resist British colonial rule."

The lower stretches of the river, known as the Tideway, extend up to Teddington Lock, reflecting its extensive tidal reach. From Oxford to its estuary, the river descends 55 metres. Although the Thames flows through some of the drier regions of mainland Britain and is heavily tapped for drinking water, its discharge is relatively low compared to its size."

Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador. Although eruptions ceased some 11 millennia ago, the area is still considered seismically active. In 1428, a major earthquake struck the area, which was felt in Barcelona more than 80 kilometres away. Today, it's a serene haven for trekkers, akin to the trails of the Western Ghats, inviting enthusiasts to explore volcanic vistas untouched by time."

This creature, the largest in the alligator family, can grow to more than 6 metres and tip the scales at upwards of 450 kilograms. Their dark scales are a masterstroke of camouflage, giving them an edge in hunting a variety of aquatic and terrestrial prey. Their role extends beyond predation, however.

Spanning across a coral canvas, this refuge boasts a diverse ecosystem. Enveloped by an expansive barrier reef, you can explore three shallow lagoons and numerous islets. But wait, there's more. The lush greenery here is a bustling neighbourhood that's home to more than a million birds from 29 different species, like the masked booby, great frigatebird and sooty tern. It's also one of the few places outside the Galápagos Islands where red-footed boobies are found. A wide variety of marine wildlife is in and around the atoll, including green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles and the mighty coconut crab, the world's largest land invertebrate."

It's also believed that the Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva, who reigned from 1199 to 1262, constructed a stone outpost on the hilltop to protect the empire's western frontier."

This area, a cornerstone of Maine's timber industry, now breathes tranquillity instead of timber clamour. Roxanne Quimby and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the US federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations. Katahdin Woods and Waters' diverse ecosystem provides a home for a variety of fauna, including moose, black bear, Canada lynx and numerous bird species like bald eagle and wood duck. It offers many outdoor activities for visitors, such as hiking, canoeing and camping. The monument has some of the darkest skies in the country due to the lack of electrical lighting in its vast expanse, making it a great place for stargazing."

The Galápagos, much like India's very own Andaman and Nicobar Islands, boasts a unique tapestry of biodiversity.

The Teton Range, named 'les trois tétons' by French explorers, towers over the landscape with its jagged peaks that defy time itself. At about 16 kilometres from Yellowstone National Park, these peaks, part of a mountain range less than 10 million years old, continue to captivate with their youthful defiance against erosion. Encompassing thriving ecosystems, the park is a sanctuary for grizzly bears, wolves and the flight of bald eagles. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over the Jackson Hole valley and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold."

A popular tourist destination, the lighthouse also became a symbol of the region's deep links to the sea. Lighthouses have been keeping sailors safe almost as long as humans have been sailing the seas. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships have often been used. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit."

The origins of these rides can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where wooden slides—'Russian Mountains'—provided seasonal entertainment. Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of Japan in Nagashima Spa Land. Once known as the  White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—buckle up, take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

Our first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national flag at the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi on August 15, 1947. Since then, it has become a tradition for the sitting prime minister to raise the flag and deliver a national address on Independence Day. Over time, the focus of the celebration has shifted from solely nationalism to a broader appreciation of Indian culture and heritage. The Indian diaspora also celebrates this day worldwide, with parades and events, especially in areas with significant Indian populations. In New York and other US cities, it has come to be recognised as 'India Day.' Independence Day is not just a reminder of our country's journey towards independence but also the ongoing commitment to build a brighter future for all."
