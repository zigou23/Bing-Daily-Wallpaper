        "description": "California\"s Joshua Tree National Park has a history that began way before it was made a national monument on August 10, 1936. Located where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts meet, it has been home to various cultures for thousands of years. Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto Culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano, and Chemehuevi peoples. The park\"s namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 1,242 square miles. Despite their name, they are not really trees, but rather a kind of succulent. Native to southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 40 feet tall."

The most iconic of them is Thor\"s Hammer, a hoodoo that overlooks a part of the park known as the \"Silent City.\" The Queen\"s Garden Trail, which leads from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point, offers even more vistas and rock formations, including the Queen Victoria hoodoo. According to the legend told by the Paiute Indigenous people who inhabited this area, hoodoos are people who have been turned to stone for their misdeeds by the trickster Coyote. Whether you\"re a hiker, a photographer, or simply a traveler, the hoodoos are waiting."

Venture deeper and you\"ll find lush spice farms where the air tingles with the scent of nutmeg and black pepper. Here, traditional Swahili dishes, including nyama choma, a roasted meat dish, and samaki wa kaupaka, fish with coconut sauce, blend spices with the bounty of the sea and land. As the sun sets, bonfires flicker into life and the island pulses with Taarab, a fusion of African, Arabic, and Indian music. With so much to see, Zanzibar proves that variety really is the spice of life."

Since its inception in 1990, it has evolved into a two-week event. A clever shift from September to July has made it easier for archaeological buffs to explore summer digs and heritage wonders. This year\"s theme of \"Archaeology and Community\" invites enthusiasts across the United Kingdom for an array of in-person and virtual events. Imagine standing amid Skara Brae\"s ancient stone houses on Scotland\"s Orkney archipelago, pictured here, where Neolithic settlers thrived over 5,000 years ago. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the \"Scottish Pompeii\" due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. So, grab your trowel, and get ready to dig deep into the incredible, storied past. Who knows what you\"ll discover!"

This thick blanket of volcanic gravel is the result of a series of eruptions in the 1700s. By 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. Volcanic soil absorbs and retains moisture, and the ash keeps its temperature favorable for growing grapes. The holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young grape plants from strong winds. La Geria\"s innovative approach to cultivation in an arid climate has been rewarded with its abundance of fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes."

While some areas struggle with overcrowding, others grapple with decreasing populations. The Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today\"s image, had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s. Today, it is home to little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalization, Gangi attracts new residents by giving away abandoned houses, on the condition that the properties are then restored."

These birds circle through the air in groups of up to 15, and at night, snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a high squeaky note that sounds like \"seek,\" sometimes a \"purr\" or even a raspy \"grhhrr.\" Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are not endangered. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of color, and a burst of life amid the sprawling branches."

According to legend, a Hindu priest, Rsi Markandaya, arrived at the island of Bali in the 8th century, discovering an area abundant in medicinal herbs and plants. The village\"s name derives from the word \"ubad,\" meaning medicine. Nestled within the verdant landscape, the village is rich in Hindu temples and local mythology. The mythical character seen in today’s image is Barong, a panther-like creature, the king of spirits, and a symbol of good fortune and prosperity. The Barong dance, performed in a decorated animal mask, is native to Bali."

In the early hours of June 28, 1969, New York City Police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and such raids were common. However, that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, stood their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids."

Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi engineered its dome, the largest brick dome ever constructed. Its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral\"s construction. It\"s not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari\"s fresco \"The Last Judgment\" to Paolo Uccello\"s intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica, and Giotto\"s Campanile, a free-standing bell tower."

It was in pre-colonial Hawaii, however, that modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. Historians believe that surfing made its way to the US in 1885, when three teenage Hawaiian princes surfed on redwood boards while on a break from boarding school in California."

Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defenses, the females\" horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males\" horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems."

Traditionally an economic hub, Osaka has twice served briefly as the imperial capital, once in the 7th and once in the 8th century. It flourished culturally during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became a major industrial center after the Meiji Restoration in1868, which restored imperial rule to Japan."

They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they beat insects to stun them and remove the stinger, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: Their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision, and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees."

Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. They\"re also great for people; tending to a garden is good exercise, and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful."

Spanning more than 1.5 million acres, the park is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife species, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life including hundreds of species of fish, sea turtles, and American crocodiles. Beyond its biodiversity, the park is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance.

People have been drinking tea for at least 5,000 years. The drink originated in China, but in the 16th and 17th centuries, it was introduced to Western merchants, who helped to spread it around the world. It is now the second-most consumed drink in the world after water."

Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of the fishing industry. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, \"vernaccia,\" meaning \"local\" or \"ours.\" One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Vernazza is sometimes described as the pearl of the Cinque Terre with its natural port, colorful houses, and green terraces overlooking a sparkling sea."

The archipelago is dotted with Marine Protected Areas, of which Misool is the largest, and includes nesting beaches for green and hawksbill turtles.

These hardy shrubs are adapted to the dry seasons, with their silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding splashes of color to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall. The saguaro also provides food and shelter for desert species and is a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O\"odham people."

Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as \"the coordination of mind and heart within each person.\" Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month."

Pictured on today\"s homepage is another iconic landmark, El Capitan. Not to be confused with its famous namesake in California, this limestone cliff towers 8,085 feet high and is often used as a waymark for travelers. Even if National Park Week is over, there are plenty of days in the year to visit the country\"s abundant natural splendor."

Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today\"s tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna\"s hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats."

They are social animals that gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting, and protection.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play."

As the moon perfectly aligns between the Earth and the sun, daylight will shift eerily to twilight. The total solar eclipse will be visible across North America, from Mazatlán, Mexico, to eastern Canada\"s Newfoundland Island, for up to four and a half minutes between 10:57 AM PST and 4:47 PM ADT. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States since August 21, 2017, although one occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months. Astronomers study the sun\"s corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere, its magnetic fields, and the behavior of Earth\"s atmosphere during the eclipse. Keep an eye on the time today and find a good spot to put on eclipse-safe solar glasses and see the golden ring emerge."

They were hunted for their fur, and their \"nuisance\" freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. Meanwhile, their lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy. The rodents have no trouble getting in, as they can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes. So, \"woodn\"t\" it be nice to give a shout-out to these creatures on International Beaver Day?"

Their large stomachs have four chambers, which, when full, account for about 30% of their body weight. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats, which helps to camouflage them within the rainforest canopy.

The following day, the streets come alive with people splashing each other in colors, giving everyone a vibrant makeover. Are you ready for the hues of Holi?"

Also known as white-eyes or wax-eyes, these birds come in a range of colors and patterns, but they all share that trademark eye ring. They have a sweet tooth for nectar, but they\"re not picky eaters, happily feeding on fruits, insects, and berries. Let\"s celebrate these beauties for adding a touch of wonder to spring!"

The World Economic Forum lists the water crisis among the top global risks, with 2.2 billion people still lacking access to clean water. From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change needed to address the crisis. This year\"s theme, \"Water for Peace,\" invites us to reflect on water\"s power to foster unity. So, are you ready to dive into a current that flows deeper than New Zealand\"s Blue Spring at Te Waihou Walkway, pictured on our homepage? This clear spring is renowned for its purity, supplying about 70% of the country\"s bottled water. For those in regions without easy access to safe water, World Water Day is here to promote greater cooperation to help conserve this crucial resource, for everyone."

The event has evolved to become a four-week celebration that attracts over 1.5 million people every year.

National Panda Day, observed on March 16, helps to raise awareness about panda conservation and their fight for survival amid the destruction of their natural habitat. To curb the threat, the Chinese government built more than 50 reserves and by 2016, pandas were reclassified from an endangered to a vulnerable species. However, with fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remaining in the wild, the fight to protect them is far from over."

In addition, as a designated International Dark Sky Park, it is an exceptional spot for stargazing. Beyond its natural wonders, the park, spanning over 600,000 acres, is also home to a rich cultural and historical legacy, including ancient pictographs, or rock paintings, from the Native American tribes that once lived here."

Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree which has grown over an arch into the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand. Whether you\"re a math geek or just in it for the treats, Pi Day is for everyone to enjoy!"

Covering an area of more than 600 square miles, it is estimated that over 10 million people live there, roughly 15% of the country\"s population. The capital city is home to a bustling urban infrastructure, featuring a complex network of traffic circles and highways. In 1864, the completion of Charoen Krung Road marked a turn in the city\"s transit by serving as a pioneering construction project utilizing Western techniques. The introduction of a complex elevated expressway network in 1972 and the Don Mueang Tollway has made it easier to drive in and out of the city. Over the years, the road network has evolved to meet the demands of this sprawling urban expanse."

The conical Arenal Volcano rises to an impressive height of 5,437 feet, standing tall above the surrounding rainforest and Lake Arenal, the largest lake in the country. The sleepy mountain roared to life in a massive 1968 eruption that buried about 6 square miles under rocks, lava, and ash and devastated three villages. The last significant volcanic activity there took place in 2010, and the once lava-lit peak is currently dormant. With over 500 species of birds, Arenal Volcano National Park is a must-visit location for birdwatchers. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including red brocket deer, pumas, white-faced monkeys, orchids, heliconias, and ferns. Arenal makes for an imposing and beautiful sight, towering over the tropical trees."

With fewer than 60,000 inhabitants, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts cobbled lanes, echoing with powerful footprints—from prehistoric tribes to the ancient Greeks and Romans to the medieval Arabs and Normans. Landmarks like the San Giorgio Cathedral and San Pietro Church awe visitors with their grandeur, and Modica\"s famous chocolate, crafted with Aztec-inspired techniques, tempts the palates of food enthusiasts. So, the next time Italy beckons, how about taking the road less traveled to Modica?"

This image shows a sea of determined faces in a 1915 Manhattan suffrage parade. Pioneers like Susan B.

A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth\"s orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published."

The original castle was destroyed by invading Vikings in 993 and a new castle was built here by the Normans. Today\"s castle is the result of various restorations in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. After surviving its share of attacks, Bamburgh Castle has made its way to the limelight due to its impressive silhouette against the North Sea, featuring in productions like \"Macbeth,\" \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" and \"Ivanhoe.\""

Horsetail Fall is a seasonal waterfall that flows only when there has been plenty of snowfall, and when temperatures have been warm enough to melt it. For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing, and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to see this mesmerizing natural spectacle. The phenomenon has earned the moniker \"firefall,\" an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event from the top of the park\"s Glacier Point that took place between 1872 to 1968. Eventually, park rangers decided that dumping embers over a cliff onto the land below wasn\"t the brightest idea."

At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK\"s first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy."

Once a mate is chosen, the pair develop a lifelong bond, a trait that has helped make them a symbol of longevity, fidelity, and good fortune in Japanese culture. These gentle creatures were also the inspiration for the traditional origami crane. According to legend, folding a thousand cranes can grant wishes."

While studying the creatures here, he concluded that many South American species, mainly reptiles and birds that could cross the vast expanse of water, had migrated to the Galápagos and gradually adapted to their surroundings."

From envelopes to lanterns, red is the dominant color, symbolizing luck and prosperity. Streets come alive with the rhythm of drums as the dragon dance takes center stage. Our homepage today shows a bird\"s-eye view of the dragons—elongated puppets with shimmering scales, animated by a team of dancers. Lunar New Year is a popular time for families to reunite and is said to be responsible for the world\"s largest annual human migration. Each year is linked to one of the 12 zodiac animals and 2024 heralds the Year of the Dragon, a symbol of nobility, power, and success."

The trees on Bonsai Rock are naturally restricted by the lack of space and nutrients, so no pruning is required. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, and this tranquil spot high in the Sierra Nevada is the perfect place to relax and explore your thoughts. It is also popular with photographers, especially at sunset."

        "description": "While other owls spend their days sleeping off the night before, the northern hawk-owl is a bird of a different feather. One of the few owls active during the day, that piercing gaze scours the boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia for prey. Northern hawk-owls aren\"t picky eaters: Mice, rats, voles, lemmings, rabbits, shrews, moles, and the occasional frog are all on the menu. These vocal birds have different calls for mating, chatting with their young, and warning that danger is nearby. If you get too close to their nest, protective parents have been known to swoop at humans to keep them away."

These squirrels are not only exceptional jumpers—capable of leaping up to 6 feet in one jump—they can even swim to search for food. They gather nuts and acorns in the autumn and hide them, to see them through the winter months. If you spot fuzzy-tailed squirrels frolicking in your backyard, they might also appreciate a feeding station stocked with treats such as raspberries or crab apples."

Their low calls can be heard by other lynx, and they are primarily active at night, dawn, and dusk, although they can hunt by day if needed. These solitary hunters have keen senses and remarkable agility, able to climb trees and jump more than 6 feet straight up to catch prey. In temperate forests, they mainly dine out on rabbits, hares, marmots, and other small mammals, although they can take on prey as large as deer."

Today, from Red Delicious to Honeycrisp to Pink Lady, some 200 varieties are grown in the US. The chaffinch on our homepage today is pictured amid tiny crab apples. Sure, they can be a bit tart, but they make for a lovely display in winter and some birds depend on them when other food is scarce. Sliced, baked, in a salad, or as cider, how do you like them apples?"

Pictured here blanketed by fog above the waters of the Golden Gate Strait, its towers, adorned with Art Deco elements, reach a height of 746 feet. The bridge opened in 1937, thanks to the efforts of engineer Joseph Strauss, architect Irving Morrow, and others who wanted to connect San Francisco to Marin County. It wasn\"t an easy vision to accomplish during the Great Depression, but the investment paid off as its construction created thousands of jobs and boosted growth. It was Morrow who picked the striking color, International Orange, an unusual choice at the time when many bridges were gray or black. He felt it would contrast well with the surrounding hills, sky, ocean, and fog. The Golden Gate Bridge, a testament to human innovation, is a timeless masterpiece blending functionality with beauty."

Tolkien\"s roots run through Oxford, where he studied English language and literature and later became a professor. Since 1979, Oxford\"s Bodleian Library has been home to the Tolkien Archive, a collection of manuscripts, artwork, and even a Middle-earth map with Tolkien\"s handwritten notes. His legacy is one of timeless fantastical tales that have delighted generations of readers since they were written more than 70 years ago. His stories encourage us to seize each day and make the most of the time that is given to us."

Prayer flags come in five repeating colors representing different elements in nature, blue for the sky, white for air, red for fire, green for water, and yellow for earth. The fluttering fabrics, inscribed with spiritual scripts, are usually raised during times of prosperity, such as on Bhutan\"s Nyinlong, their traditional day of solstice, which takes place today. As the flags fade over time, adherents believe this signifies that the prayers have been heard and are being carried away by the wind, infusing the surrounding area with positivity and spirituality."

Known for their haunting songs and acrobatic breaches, these gentle giants are a success story of the ESA.

However, our work isn\"t over. Challenges persist, from habitat loss to poaching. So, what can we do? Spread the word, support conservation efforts, participate in local initiatives, and be eco-friendly."

With two layers of fur and eyes that adapt to the Arctic\"s shifting light levels, reindeer are very versatile. You likely won\"t see them fly, but you might find a herd migrating from tundra to forest in the North Polar Region, North America, Northern Europe, or Siberia. Their hooves can expand or shrink according to ground conditions, keeping their heavy frame stable on soft ground in summer, ice in winter, and steep rooftops at Christmas. If you\"re celebrating Christmas today, we wish you a merry one."

This 100-mile-long monocline—a step-like fold—is thought to have formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons, and colorful rock formations. Capitol Reef was established as a national monument in 1937 and was designated a national park on December 18, 1971."

Large groups wander across the northern US and Canada in search of food, swooping on trees and shrubs to find fruit. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries. As spring casts its spell, these nomads settle down for the breeding season. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying two to six bluish-gray eggs, and hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia."

Poinsettias can be found growing in the wild from Mexico to Guatemala. The ancestors of the modern, commercially available version have been traced to the Mexican state of Guerrero.

The United States entered World War II immediately after the attack, and the event hastened Hawaii\"s path to become the 50th state to join the union. As 82 years have passed, few veterans of Pearl Harbor are still alive today. Lou Conter, the last surviving crew member of the USS Arizona, its memorial seen here, turned 102 in September.

That\"s where Giving Tuesday comes in. This annual holiday on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving was created by the United Nations Foundation and New York\"s 92nd Street Y—a cultural organization and community center—in 2012. Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, whether by volunteering at a non-profit organization, shelter or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community. So, let\"s jump on board with the millions of kind souls, shake hands, and share warm wishes far and wide!"

It was known as the City of the Three Cultures during the Middle Ages, when its Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities coexisted harmoniously. Toledo has been the home of sword making since Roman times and is also famous for its marzipan. In the 16th century, the city was home to the famous painter El Greco, who was inspired to create some of his greatest masterpieces here."

Written records tell of an early thanksgiving shared between Plymouth Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans, who provided a harvest of corn, deer, and turkey. There were many early days of thanksgiving, but an official, national celebration was proclaimed by George Washington in 1789, and has been a part of our holiday season ever since. Today, we wish you good company and plenty of things to be thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving!"

The Red Shirt Table, at 3,340 feet, is the highest point in the park, which was established on this day in 1978. It protects 379 square miles of rocky buttes, pinnacles, and prairies. This inhospitable terrain was called \"Mako Sica,\" or \"land bad\" by the Oglala Lakota people, who have lived here for hundreds of years. Still thirsty for knowledge?

About 30 of these small lakes can be seen from the top of the tower, nearly 100 feet in the air. These lakes can be up to 36 feet deep and are just some of the thousands of sinkholes identified in the park. Water-soluble rocks like gypsum lie under the soil in this area, and over time they gradually erode, forming caves, which then collapse. In some cases, they fill with water, creating this mesmerizing landscape. The interconnected lakes mirror the surrounding greenery, creating a scenic haven for nature enthusiasts."

The word \"paine,\" pronounced pie-neh, in the park’s name is believed to have its roots in a Tehuelche word meaning \"blue\" while \"torres\" means towers. The park is named after three striking granite peaks that reach up to 8,200 feet above sea level but boasts many other spectacular mountains. At 700 square miles, Torres del Paine is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with a huge amount to offer visitors, from hiking and kayaking to stargazing. So, pack your sense of adventure and head south to beat the blues."

Also known as the monk sloth or dwarf sloth, the species lives exclusively on a small island off Panama\"s coast, Isla Escudo de Veraguas. Pygmy three-toed sloths are much smaller than other kinds of sloths, at about 20 inches long, and they weigh less than 8 pounds. Sadly, this species is classified as critically endangered. International Sloth Day aims to raise awareness of the planet\"s slowest mammal and help them to survive and thrive in the wild, at their own pace."

The Mekong River experiences flooding every year, which turns this river into a photographer\"s paradise. Adorned with elegant lilies that are nourished by the floods, farmers in the Long An province, in southeastern Vietnam, dedicate their days to harvesting the bloom of the plants. The annual floods bring in nutrients from upstream, enriching the fields and helping these flowers grow. These lilies also provide a food supply and contribute to the community\"s economy since the stems are edible and the plant can be brewed into tea. These long-stemmed flowers pay tribute to nature\"s ability to generate moments of amazing beauty that inspire and uplift the human soul."

Solar eclipses happen when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, casting parts of Earth into shadow. In an annular solar eclipse, a halo effect is created when the moon blocks out most but not all, of the sun\"s light. An annulus—or ring—of light remains visible. Seen here from Doha, Qatar, in 2019, the phenomenon will appear today over the United States—traveling from Oregon to Texas before continuing to Central America and ending in South America. While the \"ring of fire\" is visible only in certain areas, partial eclipses will grace parts of all 50 states."

The monument itself is divided into three units, Painted Hills, Clarno, and Sheep Rock. In the latter, you\"ll find the Thomas Condon Visitor Center with a paleontology lab and a museum displaying hundreds of fossils. In the fossil beds, the remains of more than 100 species of mammals have been found, including saber-toothed tigers, turtles, and opossums, as well as many fossilized plant species. While the landscape might sometimes look otherworldly, it offers us a peek into Earth\"s dynamic and fascinating history."

It\"s a common misconception that Mount Sopris was a volcano but, although magma built up beneath its surface, it never erupted. Instead, it crystallized about 10,000 feet beneath the Earth\"s surface, creating a massive rock-covered dome. Erosion by rain, melting snow and glacial ice then shaped it into this twin-peaked giant over tens of millions of years."

These arms contain clusters of neurons, which make them particularly sensitive, and each arm can be used separately to perform complex tasks. Octopuses can also match the color—sometimes even the texture—of their environment, making them even more difficult to spot. There\"s lots more to learn about these fascinating animals, and World Octopus Day is a great day to do it. You could always start with the Academy Award-winning documentary \"My Octopus Teacher.\""

The castle—one of the oldest in Slovenia—is positioned on a precipice above the town of Bled on the northwestern shore of the lake."

The pathway\"s intricate layout, with its sharp turns and steep inclines, was an engineering marvel of its time. Via Krupp\"s panoramic vistas of the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Faraglioni rock formations, and the lush landscape of the island have drawn admiration for generations. Due to concerns over preservation and safety, because of falling rocks, the pathway has faced intermittent closures, though it reopened in June this year for the first time in nine years."

The celebrations took place on the fields in front of the city gates, which were named Theresienwiese, or Theresa\"s Meadow, in honor of the bride. The festivities lasted for five days, filled with exciting activities such as parades and horse races. It was so popular that Oktoberfest became an annual event that now draws more than 6 million people. This year\"s festival starts today and lasts 18 days.

The Przewalski\"s horse, also called the \"takhi\" in Mongolia, was once extinct in the wild but has been successfully reintroduced through conservation efforts in the 1990s. An interesting fact about these horses is that they have 66 chromosomes, compared with 64 in domestic horses. Remarkably, Przewalski\"s horses can mate with domestic horses to produce hybrids. These hybrids have 65 chromosomes and can breed and have their own offspring."

No matter what you call them, there\"s no better time to pick up the phone than Grandparents\" Day, held on the Sunday after Labor Day. Grandparents play a special role in our lives, helping to raise new generations, passing down family history and sharing the wisdom of their experience. Wisdom is not always indicated by a thick Wilford-Brimley-esque mustache, but whiskers do lend a certain esteemed quality. Perhaps that\"s why these Atlantic walruses look like they\"re about to tell you why they voted for Hubert Humphrey."

There has been a significant decline in their populations, with an estimated 63% decrease in their numbers in the last 75 years. Threats include being hit by boats or tangled in fishing gear and their habitats are being damaged by pollution, coastal development and over-fishing.

Made entirely from stone blocks, it was built in the 3rd century CE, when this area was Thysdrus, a city of ancient Rome. Once capable of seating up to 35,000 spectators, it is the largest colosseum in North Africa and one of the largest in the world. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, it is one of the best-preserved Roman amphitheatres, almost equal in grandeur to the Colosseum in Rome."

Built in 1836, the elegant lighthouse was designed by civil engineer James Walker in the Gothic style, as seen in its castle-like parapet. It has undergone many changes since then and more accommodation was added in the 1870s, but no lighthouse keepers live there now—it has been automated since 1993."

The Perseids are caused by Earth passing through debris left behind by the Comet Swift-Tuttle. When the cosmic debris hits our atmosphere, it disintegrates in a colorful, fiery light display. It\"s a good night to catch the Perseids if you can—the moon is projected to only be 10% illuminated, so the meteors should really stand out against the dark sky."

They are one of three living species of elephant, alongside their smaller relatives, the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant. Their immense size is not the only incredible thing about them. Studies suggest that elephants can recognize themselves in the mirror and that these mammals display emotions such as grief when they lose family members. World Elephant Day—held on August 12—was set up to admire them but also to highlight the difficulties they face. Amboseli National Park in Kenya—where this photograph was taken—is one of the few remaining habitats where African elephant herds can still be found in large numbers."

It\"s part of puffling season, a yearly tradition on Iceland\"s Westman Islands, home of the largest puffin colony in the world.

They pick them up with gloved hands, take them to a cliff before sundown, and toss them over the edge. Why? Well, the lights of the town can confuse pufflings, who use the light of the moon and stars to guide them to the ocean, where they live for much of the year. Residents are simply doing their part to ensure they find their way to their natural habitat."

It was in use for centuries until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, when Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church. The building fell into ruin but, as the centuries passed, word of its intricate stones and romantic, pastoral setting spread. From painter J. M. W. Turner to poet William Wordsworth, many artists were drawn to the abbey over the years. This majestic ruin is now a national icon on the Welsh bank of the River Wye, on the border between Wales and England. There\"s another abbey in County Wexford, Ireland, of the same name. Back in olden days, the one in Wales was often known as \"Tintern Major,\" while the Ireland one was called \"Tintern de Voto\" (Tintern of the Vow)."

        "description": "Behold the rugged grandeur of Utah\"s red rock country. This hidden gem of the American Southwest is Capitol Reef National Park, a tapestry of towering cliffs, twisting canyons, colorful sandstone buttes, and sweeping desert landscapes. Less popular than Zion and Bryce Canyon, the park offers a pleasantly uncrowded experience for visitors keen to enjoy this spectacular landscape. It is also home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including the elusive desert bighorn sheep and more than 230 bird species. But its crown jewel is the nearly 100-mile long Waterpocket Fold, a 7,000-foot-high step in the rock layers, officially known as a monocline. This massive wrinkle on the surface of the planet was formed around 50 to 70 million years ago."

In a bid to scale the tallest peaks and conquer difficult terrain around the world, mountain climbers embark on physically strenuous journeys that demand exceptional training and experience. But the panoramic views and sense of achievement after reaching the summit makes the effort worthwhile. Our image today is that of Denali, North America\"s highest peak at 20,310 feet, in south-central Alaska. The name \"Denali\" means \"the high one\" in the native Athabascan language. Four climbers, Walter Harper, Harry Karstens, Robert Tatum, and Hudson Stuck, were the first to set foot on the top of the mountain in 1913."

Long before European settlers arrived, the area\"s Native American people are believed to have used Rock House as a refuge. Small recesses in the rock walls are thought to have been used as baking ovens, while troughs gouged in the cave\"s floor helped them to collect water. The walls of Rock House have seven window-like openings, allowing sunlight to filter through, casting beautiful patterns inside the cave and offering cliffside views over the trees for generations of Rock House dwellers."

These hardy trees and shrubs are halophytes, salt-tolerant plants that can filter 90% of the salt from the seawater they live in. Despite their resilience, mangroves are threatened globally, largely due to human activity. Mangrove coverage is thought to have halved over the past 40 years, and they are dwindling much faster than forests overall. The UN has established the International Day of Mangrove Conservation, scientific funding, Global Geoparks, and World Heritage sites to try to reverse these trends. These efforts are vital; mangroves help prevent erosion and protect against storm surges, as well as providing a home for fish, crustaceans, and other wildlife."

This results in the rosy tinge that protects the algae from solar radiation. And the pink is just getting started, as the algae are eaten by tiny crustaceans, which turn pink and are then eaten by flamingos, which acquire the rosy hue as well."

It took six years, and during construction workers were pelted by the region\"s unpredictable weather, including 12 hurricanes. It opened in 1989 and remains a popular visitor attraction.

        "description": "Today, on Shark Awareness Day, let\"s dive into the ocean\"s depths to meet our finned friends. It\"s believed that sharks have been cruising the oceans for at least 420 million years. Today’s homepage shows blacktip reef sharks, hunting in a group in the waters around the Maldives, one of more than 500 species of shark, each uniquely adapted to its habitat. From the graceful hammerhead with its panoramic vision to the fastest species, the sleek mako, shark species are diverse, but a third face extinction. Among threats are unregulated fishing and abandoned nets as well as demand for shark fins. They have a fearsome reputation but are the victims of myths and misconceptions that paint them as mindless killing machines. Today, let\"s celebrate these magnificent creatures, a key part of healthy marine ecosystems, by advocating for their conservation."

Many perfumes, modern and historical, have featured lavender, and Queen Elizabeth I is purported to have used lavender scent. You’ll find lavender fields scattered across the country. This one is a typical example, a quintessential summer sight here in the picturesque county of Somerset, in southwest England."

Of course, no scientific explanation can capture the magic of a shared kiss. Perhaps that\"s why artists including Prince, Faith Hill, and Hall & Oates have all had chart-toppers about lip-locking; they have found a way to put an indescribable feeling into words."

Greek islands like Corfu may seem timeless and ancient but they are relatively new in the history of Earth. A leading theory is that around 5.3 million years ago, a great flood poured in between Africa and Europe from the Atlantic Ocean, an event called the Zanclean flood. Lakes became oceans and what were previously mountaintops became islands."

That date, enshrined on the Declaration document, became the one we observe today.

The competition is divided into 21 day-long stages and while some parts stay the same, others vary from year to year. For example, our image features the Pont du Gard—an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that was built during the first century AD—which only appeared in the 2019 race. The entire event takes place over a 23-day period, including rest days, as teams of eight cyclists compete for a cash prize and the coveted yellow jersey.

The château\"s gardens showcase the harmonious relationship between architecture and nature. Stunning gardens have surrounded the château since it was built in 1532, but their appearance changed drastically over the centuries. After Joachim Carvallo acquired the estate, he spent 10 years from 1918 reinventing and restoring the Renaissance formal gardens. Other elements have been added in the decades since and the gardens continue to captivate visitors to this day."

While they dine out on nectar, they get a light dusting of pollen, which is then spread to other flowers they land on. This process is pollination, transferring pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, and is crucial for growing many of our fruits and vegetables. It improves the quality and quantity of crops and increases harvest yields. Nearly $20 billion of goods are produced in the US alone each year, because of pollination."

Texas issued an order on June 19, 1865, that \"all slaves are free.\" This act was the origin of Juneteenth, which combines the words June and nineteenth. However, slavery did not fully end in the US until the 13th Amendment was ratified on December 6, 1865."

Each year, National Trails Day brings together nature lovers, government agencies, and businesses to preserve hiking trails for everyone to enjoy. Looking for a stunning spot to stretch your legs? We suggest South Kaibab Trail in the Grand Canyon, seen here. The trail starts with a series of switchbacks known as \"The Chimney,\" which leads to a steep, narrow descent—prepare for an invigorating workout! All that hard work will pay off though—fresh air and exertion can boost your mood, improve sleep, and reduce the risk of heart disease. Not to mention the panoramic views you can enjoy from the trail\"s scenic viewpoints."

This lonely gemsbok, seen here in sand dunes in Namibia, is used to living in an inhospitable environment. Also known as the oryx, it is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, especially around the Namib and Kalahari deserts. The gemsbok does not need to drink much water, instead finding hydration in the vegetation it grazes upon—including wild tsamma melons and cucumbers. When vegetation is sparse, they can dig deep to find roots and tubers to supplement their diet."

But while they look cute, these furry critters are also the top predators in their food chain, \"otterly\" vital to keeping ecosystems in balance. Sea otters eat sea urchins and without them, sea urchins spread across the sea floor, destroying crucial kelp forests which provide food and shelter for many other aquatic animals. Unfortunately, sea otters are one of five otter species listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Five others are listed as near-threatened and two as vulnerable. Of the 13 otter species worldwide, only the North American river otter’s population is considered to be stable. On the last Wednesday in May, World Otter Day seeks to raise awareness about the threats to otters, and how to protect them."

Bali\"s rivers and streams provide year-round water for its crops but here people work hand-in-hand with nature, and a network of irrigation channels distribute water to each paddy field. They carefully tend rice plants during the growing season, as generations have done before them, before harvesting and distributing the rice between the community. The Subak system is so important in Balinese culture, it has been recognised by UNESCO. These terraces offer visitors panoramic views over the surrounding rice fields and lush landscape, as well as a picturesque example of people living in harmony with nature."

They held off three Ottoman sieges in 1537, 1571, and 1716 but have been repaired, rebuilt, and added to over the centuries. The Old Fortress has witnessed the rise and fall of mighty empires for hundreds of years, from the tip of a rocky peninsula jutting into the sea. These days, however, it is home to the public library and Corfu\"s archives."

Agriculture has long been important here, with bananas, tomatoes, and potatoes among the main crops. But while the first voyagers came in search of trade, today\"s visitors come to explore the many beautiful national parks and relax on beaches like the Playa del Matorral on Fuerteventura, seen here during a spectacular sunset."

But for the first year or so of its life, it will rely on mom to feed it and keep it safe from predators. We honor mothers and maternal figures everywhere on the second Sunday in May. It was first celebrated in the US in 1908 and was made a national holiday six years later in 1914, thanks to campaign efforts by social activist Anna Jarvis. While Jarvis became known as the founder of Mother\"s Day in the US, she later complained that it had become too commercial and began to vocally oppose it. You don\"t need to spend a fortune to let mom know you love her. Like our homepage fawn, you can simply spend some quality time with her today, to show how much you appreciate your nearest and \"deer\"-est."

        "description": "The migration of birds, such as the pelicans seen here over California\"s Salton Sea, is part of the pulse of our planet\"s ecosystem. Around 40% of bird species migrate, typically in the fall and spring, some traveling incredible distances. Tiny hummingbirds can migrate 500 miles across the Gulf of Mexico overnight. Arctic terns fly between the Arctic and Antarctic each year, potentially racking up more than 1.5 million miles over a lifetime. The bar-tailed godwit can travel 7,000 miles in eight days, without stopping. On World Migratory Bird Day, we can help our feathered friends by protecting their habitats and taking simple steps like leaving less lights on at night, leaving out birdseed, and making windows more visible to avoid collisions."

They are not just a stunning addition to the landscape—they are crucial for the survival of the rare Karner blue butterfly. The larvae of the short-lived species will only feed on wild blue lupines, crawling up their stems to eat new leaves when they hatch. Once widespread across much of eastern North America, wild lupines have been in decline since the Industrial Revolution and human development has reduced their range. This has had a knock-on effect on the butterflies, which are now an endangered species. Conservation efforts have focused on replanting areas of wild blue lupines to boost butterfly numbers."

Over millennia, the rain seeped in and slowly dissolved the rock from the inside, forming these eye-catching sculptures. Most of the arches in the national park are formed from Entrada Sandstone and were once buried by other rock layers. They won\"t last forever, but over time, new shapes will emerge from the layers of rock below to replace them. Every year, close to 1.4 million people visit the park to see Delicate Arch and this slowly shifting landscape for themselves."

This little door leads to an underground cellar near the village of Pünzendorf, and its naturally low temperature once made it an ideal place to store the beer and wine the area is famous for. These days, you might be more likely to find bats inside, so perhaps it\"s better admired from a distance."

Island foxes exist only on the Channel Islands of Southern California. You can find them on six of the eight islands, and each island\"s fox is considered a unique subspecies. While numbers have never been huge, they declined catastrophically in the 1990s. Thanks to a recovery program, their population is growing steadily, and these tiny foxes have bounced back from the brink of extinction. If you want to visit Channel Islands National Park to see this success story, today is a good day to go.

Though simple, a great haiku creates a sense of beauty and a connection to nature.

In fact, you can easily make your own, and there\"s no better time than today: Go Fly a Kite Day."

The Easter egg has long been a symbol of fertility and rebirth, but exactly why people started decorating them is unclear. One theory is that, because animal products were not eaten during the religious Lenten season, people would hard-boil the eggs and decorate them with dye and wax, until they could be eaten at Easter. A more opulent type of decorated egg, Fabergé eggs, were famously created as bejeweled Easter gifts to the Russian imperial family. Our homepage image shows eggs from Lithuania, where people use traditional methods to paint patterns with wax using sharp objects or etch patterns into dyed eggs."

As you go about your day, stop and take in the colors around you and think about why they were chosen and how they make you feel. It might just make you consider how you use color in your own life."

They are nighttime predators that fly over open lands to hunt rats and mice. During heavy rain, they are unable to hunt because their feathers aren\"t waterproof, leaving them vulnerable to starvation during long periods of wet weather. Although some see them as a symbol of wisdom and fortune, their haunting cries and ghostly appearance mean they have often been seen as bad omens in rural areas."

One of the most spectacular wildlife ecosystems on the planet, the park is home to rhinos, leopards, elephants, giraffes—and a huge lion population. The grassland here is dotted with rock formations that stick out like islands, the largest of which, the simba kopjes, are popular hangouts for lions and are said to have inspired Pride Rock in \"The Lion King.\" In the heat of the Serengeti, lush trees provide the perfect shelter for lions to take a nap and reenergize. We hope you are as cozy as you curl up and recuperate on National Napping Day."

Built between 1904 and 1906, it was designed by the famous Austrian architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer in the Neo-Baroque style, popular in the late 19th century. This opulent style nodded back to the grandiosity of the Baroque movement, which began in Rome in the 1600s and flourished across Europe. The building houses both the national theater and the Romanian Opera and plays host to a wide array of cultural events here in Romania\"s second-largest city."

These apex predators are at the top of the food chain with a diet that includes a smorgasbord of sea creatures including fish, penguins, and even sharks and whales. They hunt in pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals that work together using special hunting techniques sometimes likened to packs of wolves. Despite their scary name, they almost never attack humans and there are no documented cases of wild orcas killing anyone. The name \"killer whale\" is thought to come from Spanish sailors who saw groups of them hunting big whales. Orcas are also the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae."

Hippos can live up to 40 years in the wild and possess the largest mouth of any land animal in the world, so smiling for the camera comes naturally."

Thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney each year to witness the groundhog emerge from its burrow, and more importantly, to see if the critter spots its shadow. If it does, winter will go on for six weeks, according to tradition. If it does not, spring-like conditions are said to be coming. Studies have yet to prove any link between the two events, but that hasn’t cast a shadow over this unusual tradition, which remains as popular as ever in the 21st century."

These days, the sport is enjoyed as a recreational and competitive activity using a variety of boats, boards, skates, and kites. The world championships, which fall under the broader umbrella of windsurfing competitions, have been held since 1980.

To reach the arch, you must either ride a cable car or take a bus up a twisty, winding road with 99 turns. (The number 9 represents eternity in Chinese numerology.) Once off the bus, you\"ll need to walk 999 steps up a 45-degree incline—a stairway to the heavens. It\"s no easy feat, but this is no ordinary cave. At an elevation of 4,100 feet, the arch is 440 feet high and 180 feet wide."

This warm-hearted occasion was created in 1986 by a man named Kevin Zaborney, who chose Jan 21 because it fell after the run of year-end holidays, landing right in the middle of winter when spirits tend to be low. That makes perfect sense to us! After all, hugging has been an essential part of the human experience for thousands of years. And studies have shown that it reduces stress, too. So find yourself a willing partner today and hug it out. You\"ll feel better, we promise."

Kings are the second-largest penguin species, only outranked in stature by their emperor penguin cousins. And while the kings\" tuxedo coloring gives them a dash of the debonair, it also provides an important and more practical purpose: camouflage. When the birds dive deep into the ocean looking for food, their black feathers disguise the birds from predators above, while their white undersides do the reverse. Kings are legendary for their diving prowess—in their quest for tasty squid and lanternfish, they can dive to depths of 300 feet, and some have even been spotted nearly 1,000 feet beneath the surface. Underwater, these flightless birds are the epitome of grace. On land, however, they are not so graceful, and waddle or \"toboggan\" on their bellies to get around."

The term \"fell\" originates from the Old Norse term for mountain, but it mostly applies to high, barren areas and, in the Lake District specifically, the area was usually uncultivated and used for grazing. Black Fell, which is a little over 1,000 feet high, has some acclaim, having been mentioned in Alfred Wainwright\"s \"Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells\" as a prime viewing area. No matter which direction you gaze, you\"re sure to see something wonderful."

Well, sandhill cranes aren\"t picky; they\"ll eat whatever\"s available, from plants and grains, to insects, snails, and even snakes. And they have plenty of avian company at this beautiful refuge each winter—whooping cranes, ducks, and snow geese from as far away as Alaska and Siberia also count Bosque del Apache as a favorite resting spot before heading north to their breeding grounds when the days get warmer. Thankfully, there\"s plenty of room to spread their wings at the 57,000-acre refuge."

It then served as an important strategic stronghold before again falling into disrepair. In the 19th century, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, best remembered for his commitment to building great works across Germany, had a new castle built on the grounds, replacing almost all the 15th-century construction. Today, Hohenzollern Castle is an open-air museum that hosts more than 350,000 visitors per year, making it one of the most-visited castles in Germany."

Cosmopolitan Miami Beach is perpetually fixed inside the lens of the world as a playground for the wealthy, glamorous, and aesthetically advantaged set. You\"re likely to hear many languages spoken while strolling the sidewalks of Miami Beach. It\"s home to the music academy known as the New World Symphony, and host to the visual arts festival, Art Basel. Miami Beach also boasts the world\"s largest array of preserved Art Deco structures. It\"s a favorite haunt of celebrities—none of whom can outshine the real star, this beach of endless sand."

        "description": "No doubt your eyes are drawn to the large, silver-bluish leaf in today\"s photo, but there\"s a little more to this colorful display. We\"re on the floor of a Mexican rainforest to examine a large Cecropia leaf and some lobster claw petals. The genus called Cecropia contains some of the most recognizable neotropical trees anywhere, but the roughly 60 different species can be hard to tell apart. All Cecropias grow fast, by tree standards anyway. On average, they\"ll climb about 2.5 feet per year and under perfect conditions can grow as much as 10 feet in that time, eventually reaching around 60 feet tall. When dried, Cecropia leaves shrivel into a fist-like form which displays interesting patterns and shapes. Not only are Cecropias very popular with animals like sloths, monkeys, and toucans for their fruit and leaves, many species have a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants. Cecropias provide shelter and food for ants, and the ants in turn defend the trees from plant-eating predators."

        "description": "While not everyone would recognize this as an olive tree, most of us understand the meaning of the phrase \"extending an olive branch,\" long known as a gesture of peace and friendship. That sentiment of compassion, harmony, and wisdom is at the heart of UNESCO\"s World Olive Tree Day, created in 2019 and observed every November 26. The intent of the day is to bring attention to the resolution of conflict worldwide and to the preservation of the olive tree itself, like this one standing in front of the Temple of Concordia in Agrigento, Italy. The well-preserved, Greek Doric temple was built on what is now the south shore of Sicily, around 440 BCE. Olive trees are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and are cultivated today in places with similar climates, like parts of California and Israel. About 90% of harvested olives are used to make olive oil, the quintessential ingredient in Mediterranean cooking."

Built by people of the Mississippian culture, construction of Monks Mound began early in the 900s CE in present day southern Illinois. By around 1050 the area had grown into a major hub of commerce and agriculture now known as Cahokia. With a population that may have exceeded 40,000 at its peak, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities of Mexico and Central America. In the 13th century, for reasons still debated by scholars, the city began to decline, and it was abandoned around 1350. Excavations in the 19th and 20th century revealed a society far more sophisticated and complex than many had believed existed north of Mesoamerica previously."

This photo gives you an idea just how many people will be running today. Because the race starts early on a November morning, many runners show up in layered clothing to beat the typical chill. But once they heat up from running, those layers come off and are often discarded on sidewalks. Race organizers collect the activewear left behind by 50,000 runners, about 26 tons a year, and donate it to charity."

It was loaded with more than 5,000 artifacts, including a solid gold coffin, face mask, thrones, archery bows, trumpets, a lotus chalice, furniture, food, wine, sandals, gold caps to protect Tut\"s toes, and fresh linen underwear.

It was 75 years ago today that Howard Hughes\" \"flying boat,\" dubbed the \"Spruce Goose,\" made its one and only flight. Officially named the Hughes H-4 Hercules, the press persisted in calling it the \"Spruce Goose\" even though it was constructed almost entirely of birch wood. The plane was commissioned in 1942 by American industrialist Henry Kaiser, who supplied ships to the US during World War II. Kaiser recruited Hughes—the film producer turned pilot, engineer, and business magnate—to build a flying cargo ship that could avoid German submarines while transporting troops and war supplies across the Atlantic. The contract called for three of the planes to be built within two years. Hughes was still working on the design when the war ended—in the end, he delivered only the one in our photo, two years after V-E Day."

Perhaps that\"s because technically it\"s the birthday of the premier authority on all things related to sea slugs, Terry Gosliner. Gosliner has identified nearly half of the known sea slug species in the world, has written 150 scientific papers about them, and has personally named around 350 individual species. \"Everything about them just piques the imagination,\" he says.

Rangoli designs are more than just attractive—they\"re believed to attract Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. Each day of the festival has its own significance, but day three—called Lakshmi Puja—is considered the main event. To prepare for Lakshmi Puja, people clean their homes to welcome Lakshmi\"s blessings of prosperity and happiness. A rangoli design is created near the entrance to a home or building, and families pass down traditional designs from generation to generation."

To commemorate the event, the museum has unveiled a slogan: \"Art Inspires Future.\" The museum has also released a special edition of its logo in which the characteristic Gs of the Guggenheim brand move like gears to shape the number 25. Perhaps they\"ll serve cake as well?"

This site and the area around it are of huge significance to the history of Iran and its people. They\"re also a shining example of the role archaeology plays in understanding our past.

This stunning fossil display is known as the Ammonite Pavement, where thousands of ammonite fossils are embedded in a limestone ledge at the west end of Monmouth Beach in Dorset. Although the ammonites look rather like snail shells, these are fossils of extinct sea creatures that are more closely related to today\"s octopus or squid. Britain\"s Natural History Museum notes that the fossil-filled ledge is unique in the world because of the sheer number and size of the ammonites: The fossils reach up to 27 inches in diameter. If you want to check them out, timing is everything—the ledge emerges at low tide, and there are more ammonites in large rocks nearby, too."

Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That\"s why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or \"Spirit of the Puffing Wind.\""

Most of them were built between 1825 and 1875 to cross a stream or river and were intended to withstand the elements. An uncovered wooden bridge may have a life span of only about 20 years while a covered bridge could stand for more than 100. Even still, they don\"t fare well without upkeep and restoration costs can be high. That\"s why iron replaced wood as the preferred bridge-building material in the mid-1800s. These days, fewer than 900 of the original wooden covered bridges are believed to still be standing. The A. M. Foster Bridge, seen in today\"s photo, can be found in Cabot, Vermont."

They include what is perhaps the most famous geyser of them all: Old Faithful. But the Upper Basin contains many other geysers as well, including the tallest predictable geyser (Grand Geyser) and the most voluminous geyser (Giant Geyser). Yellowstone contains about 500 geysers, roughly two-thirds the number in the entire world."

From late September until early November, males will be strutting their stuff, locking antlers with one another, and competing for the attention of females in hopes of furthering the species. Successful males will mate with 15-20 females a season. After the rutting season males will shed their antlers while females keep theirs until spring. In today\"s photo we\"re looking at some caribou in southcentral Alaska crossing the Susitna River."

It accounts for 20% of all fresh water that flows into the world\"s seas and oceans. It\"s also the vital heart of the largest and most diverse rainforest in the world. The Amazon rainforest is home to a third of the world\"s animal species and its trees and plants pull billions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, making it one of the Earth\"s best defenses against climate change."

Golden jellyfish are a subspecies unique to this small lake, on this small island—they\"re found nowhere else on the planet. Millions of teacup-sized golden jellies inhabit the lake, following the sunlight that nourishes them. Symbiotic algae live inside the jellyfish and provide their hosts with energy as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The more sun the jellies get, the more energy they derive from their hitchhikers. The jellies start the day at the east end of the lake and drift westward until dusk, following the arc of the sun."

Groups of either males or females (sometimes with pups), are appropriately named rafts. Male rafts tend to be larger and can number more than 1,000 individuals. Sea otters\" buoyant bodies indeed work like literal rafts, standing in as cradles, dinner tables, or any kind of solid surface. That\"s handy because otters spend the vast majority of their lives in the water, even giving birth in the sea. Although they seem to live carefree lives, frolicking and grooming and diving, they also serve an important role in keeping their aquatic ecosystems healthy, something to remember this week as we mark Sea Otter Awareness Week, observed every year during the last week of September."

This was the remnants of the Spanish fleet that had set sail under the command of Ferdinand Magellan almost exactly three years previously with the goal of finding a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. While Magellan gets the glory as leader of the expedition, he didn\"t actually complete the marathon voyage—he had been killed in a skirmish in the Philippines in April 1521. In the end, his place as leader of the five-ship voyage was filled by Juan Sebastián Elcano, whose command ship, the \"Vittoria,\" was the only one in the convoy that survived the trip. Harsh conditions, starvation, scurvy, hostile encounters, and other struggles had taken their toll: Of the roughly 270 crew members who set out, only 18 returned with the expedition."

By the time of this 1934 strike, the textile industry had been struggling for years to keep pace with the economic times, and workers were struggling as their wages were cut while their workloads increased. Things came to a head after the National Industrial Recovery Act became law in 1933, leading to the formation of the Textile Industry Committee meant to represent the interests of business owners, consumers, and workers—but this only led to shortened workweeks, effectively reducing wages by 25%. Workers rushed to join the United Textile Workers union to get their voices heard and demand improved conditions."

We are remembering this seminal flight today to mark National Aviation Day, established in 1939 by President Franklin Roosevelt as a day to celebrate the advancement of flight. August 19 was chosen because it is the birthdate of Orville Wright, who in 1903, with his brother Wilbur Wright, became the first to achieve powered, controlled flight on the hills of Kitty Hawk on North Carolina\"s Outer Banks."

For the uninitiated, that means we\"re in Sweden and cracking open this year\"s surströmming harvest to enjoy its putrid wonder. Surströmming is Baltic herring that\"s been caught in April and May, then lightly salted and allowed to ferment. Beginning in the 1940s, a royal ordinance forbade the selling of Surströmming before the third Thursday in August to prevent incompletely fermented fish from being sold. The ordinance is no longer on the books, but the tradition holds."

At one time there were almost 100 bodies of water, most of them ponds fed by natural catchment and rainfall, although now there are only 20. Chittorgarh (\"garh\" means \"fort,\" so it\"s also known as Chittor Fort) is so old, no one is sure exactly when it was built, although reports of its earliest capture go back to the 8th century. It is one of six large forts in the northwestern state of Rajasthan referred to as the Hill Forts of Rajasthan, all of them collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We\"re featuring this important and ancient complex on India\"s 75th Independence Day, one of India\"s three national holidays."

After the invention of the internal combustion engine, the shape reminded many people of spark plugs, so they started calling them \"spark plug lighthouses.\" Most caisson lighthouses are offshore or on dangerously exposed sites, but this is the only spark plug lighthouse in the country that visitors can walk to."

The vibrant colors are determined by brine shrimp, algae, and other microorganisms and their responses to different levels of salt. This orange results from a mid-level saline concentration and the presence of tiny brine shrimp in the water. Green indicates low levels of salt, while pink or red are signs of high salt content in an algae-rich pond."

        "description": "Today we\"re taking a tramping trip to New Zealand\"s South Island to visit the place Rudyard Kipling once called the eighth wonder of the world, Milford Sound and its surrounding rainforest. Tramping, New Zealand-speak for hiking, is incredibly popular at Milford Sound. Nearly a million tourists visit the fjord every year, despite its somewhat remote location. Originally overlooked by European explorers, the area is now known for its beauty and abundance of wildlife. It\"s not uncommon for visitors to spot dolphins, humpback whales, and native Fiordland penguins."

The Nabataeans were Arab people whose precise origins are unknown. They lived in northern Arabia and the Southern Levant. Mada\"in Saleh was their second-largest and southernmost city after Petra, their capital city to the north. About halfway between Petra and Mecca, Mada\"in Saleh served primarily as a trading crossroads and was instrumental in establishing the Nabataeans as prosperous middlemen to the rest of the ancient world."

Mangrove forests, like this one in Saloum Delta National Park in Senegal, are vital components of the world\"s coastal ecosystems. Mangroves survive where no other trees can, in salty, low-oxygen coastal waters exposed to tides and storms. They grow up to 30 feet high primarily in tropical and subtropical regions and are able to store vast amounts of carbon, making them crucial to moderating our climate. Mangroves also act as nurseries for fish and aquatic life. And with their complex, interwoven root systems, they protect coastlines from erosion. Today we join the UN in shining a light on the necessity and fragility of mangroves: July 26 is the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem."

You may know it as a carousel, like the Golden Gallopers Carousel at the seaside in Brighton, England, seen in today\"s photo. The word \"carousel\" is possibly derived from the Spanish \"carosella,\" meaning \"little war.\" Carousels have a history that goes back centuries, with roots in medieval jousting competitions. As the war game grew in popularity, commoners without horses wanted to participate, and carousels with wooden horses soon appeared at fairgrounds. The popularity of carousels led to many advancements over the years, including the up and down galloping menagerie of animals real and imagined, and the instantly recognizable music that became widespread after 1803."

She was doubly a pioneer of her day, a skilled pilot when flying was a relatively new and daring endeavor, and a woman in a field dominated by men. Earhart\"s legend was made, sadly, not as much by her piloting accomplishments as by her sudden disappearance in 1937 when her fame was still ascending. The 39-year-old famously went missing, along with navigator Fred Noonan, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, near Howland Island, while attempting to fly around the world. The official search for Earhart and Noonan lasted 17 days. The US Navy and Coast Guard searched 150,000 square miles of the Pacific, an effort that became the most expensive search in history at the time. Her husband, George Putnam, led a private search in the months that followed. No verified trace of Earhart, Noonan, or the twin-propeller Lockheed Electra plane has ever been found."

One of the brothers had injured his leg on the journey, but in the morning it had healed. Taking this as an omen, they vowed to honor the Virgin Mary by building her a church on the spot where they\"d found the icon. They began dropping stones there, and even scuttling old ships. A tradition was born, and over decades, the fishermen of Perast would drop a stone in the water at that spot before heading to sea."

The site here in the county of Suffolk, in eastern England, was originally home to a powerful Benedictine abbey in medieval times—in fact, 2022 marks the 1,000th anniversary of the storied abbey. You can still visit the abbey ruins and marvel at the 14th-century Great Gate and Norman Tower, which have survived through the ages. Nathaniel Hodson took the original abbey gardens and designed them as a botanical garden in 1831, using the Royal Botanic Gardens in Brussels, with their concentric circles, as his inspiration."

Once widespread across the American plains and revered by Native Americans, they numbered in the tens of millions. Tragically, settlers hunted the bison nearly to extinction by the late 1800s. Fewer than 1,000 of the giants were left in 1905 when the American Bison Society was formed to save them. These days, the population has stabilized with a little more than half a million bison spread across the country, with a few thousand living freely on the plains at Yellowstone."

The headland is named for Spanish Basque explorer Don Bruno de Heceta, who led a secret expedition in 1775 to bolster Spain\"s claim to the Pacific Coast of North America. Having sailed from Mexico, by the time the voyage reached these shores, the crew was ravaged by scurvy and Heceta made the call to turn back—but not before he became the first to map and record a written description of the mouth of the Columbia River as well as this rocky 1,000-foot-high headland that would eventually bear his name. By the 19th century, seafarers making their way up and down the coast made the call for a lighthouse to guide their way. Construction of the 56-foot-tall lighthouse was complicated by the steep bluffs and remote location, but the first light beam pierced through the darkness on March 30, 1894."

The gorgeous swallowtail is welcome in any garden, both for its beauty and its ability to pass pollen from flower to flower. Far less desired are swallowtails in their caterpillar form, which can take a toll on ornamental plants or citrus crops. There are more than 550 swallowtail butterfly species, and their name comes from the forked appearance of their hindwings, which can be seen when the butterfly is resting with its wings spread."

To celebrate, we\"re venturing into a tropical forest in Queensland, Australia, to visit one of nature\"s most protective fathers, the southern cassowary, the largest of three species of this flightless bird. The cassowary has earned the title of the \"world\"s most dangerous bird\" because of its sharp, dagger-like claws and aggressive behavior. Cassowaries, like this doting father and his chicks, are notorious for attacking and sometimes killing domestic animals and even humans. In the wild, adult birds are so belligerent that they have no natural predators. Their young, however, need some protection. That\"s when dad steps in."

A sport, a pastime, an art, a philosophy of life, surfing is as close to magic as a person can perform on the untamed ocean. Today, the sport of wave riding gets its well-earned due with International Surfing Day, a time each year to honor the sport, the lifestyle of surfing, and the ocean itself, whose good health is vital to the sport and so much else. Surfers have a special connection to the ocean and the waves it produces. A surfable wave is shaped by countless variables: The winds hundreds or thousands of miles away that produced the energy to set the swells in motion, and then the reef or point of land or underwater boulder upon which a swell will break into a perfectly shaped wave. Wind and timing are everything, and devoted surfers know the weather and the shore intimately."

The site is hidden away in ancient trees, with tranquil ponds and streams, gentle hiking trails, and gorgeous pagodas. The temple still ekes out its day in the traditional way, with mellow bells and meditation. The monks also cultivate wild tea plants and are happy to share the benefits of the harvest. You are at peace as soon as you arrive at Seonamsa, and there\"s little to distract you from the present moment."

The wildlife drawn to this life-sustaining water includes lions, leopards, cheetahs, rhinos, giraffes, zebras, hippos, wildebeests, hyenas, crocodiles, impalas, and of course elephants, the planet\"s largest land animals."

Once pinned near the surface, the sardines are easy pickings for the hungry dolphins and any other lucky bystanders, like these dive-bombing Cape gannets who are quick to pounce on the opportunity. The technique requires teamwork of course but that comes easy to dolphins, known for their intelligence and tight familial bonds."

The beauty and diversity of species contained within its pristine 270 square miles are the perfect inspiration for World Reef Day, observed every year on June 1 to bring awareness to this vital but largely unseen part of our natural world. Reef Day also kicks off World Oceans Month, a time to celebrate and learn more about these indispensable ecosystems."

These long-lived, charismatic, intelligent, loyal, and affectionate creatures are threatened by habitat loss, competition from invasive species, and trapping for the pet trade. Indeed, the qualities that make them darlings of the animal world also make them attractive as pets for people."

Opened on this day in 1937, the bridge was a marvel of engineering, built to withstand ferocious winds above and swirling currents below. Its construction was embraced by the local population because it would finally connect the rising metropolis of San Francisco to communities in Marin County and all that lay north. Before the bridge was completed, a ferry was the only way across the Golden Gate, the mile-wide strait that connects the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco Bay. Building a bridge to cross the span would be no small feat, and many thought it impossible."

Ensuing leaders would continue construction of the complex, turning it into one of the finest examples of architecture from the historic Islamic world. The palace was the final hold of the Moors before the completion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, when the Alhambra became the royal court of Ferdinand and Isabella. They greeted Christopher Columbus there later that same year."

And tens of thousands of flowering plants, like the crocuses in today\"s photo, would not exist if it weren\"t for the little buzzers. A quote often misattributed to Albert Einstein suggests humans would have only four years left to live if the bees go extinct. No matter who said it, the message is clear: Our livelihood is intimately tied to the survival of bees. And that connection is of critical importance now, as bee colonies continue to struggle after more than 20 years of mass die-offs, a phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder."

Located at the southern end of the Aegean Sea, Santorini is part of the Cyclades group of islands and receives about 2 million visitors a year. That\"s a lot of adoring attention for a small island (only 28 square miles) of 15,000 residents, and it\"s no wonder why. The whitewashed, clifftop villages of Santorini, like Oia featured in this image, are postcard-perfect. And so are the unlimited panoramic views of the azure Mediterranean Sea."

Seen in today\"s photo is Panther Creek Falls at Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state. Officially, the forest was named in 1949 in honor of Pinchot, the first head of the US Forest Service. Located between Mount St. Helens to the west and Mount Adams to the east, the land was set aside as a place worth preserving as far back as 1897. But people had been living in the forest for more than 6,000 years. Archaeologists continue to make discoveries within the dense forest that teach us about the past lives of Native Americans."

These and similar rock formations are known by many names—hoodoos, tent rocks, earth pyramids, as well as fairy chimneys—and are typically found in dry, hot areas. Here in Cappadocia, in south-central Turkey, they were formed when a thick layer of volcanic ash solidified over millions of years into soft, porous rock called tuff that was overlaid by hard basalt. Cracks in the basalt allowed wind and rain to gradually wash away the softer bottom layer, leaving the hard basalt to cap tall columns of the tuff. The result is these unusual, often beautiful—and perhaps puzzling—formations that spread across the Anatolian plain."

The bluebell is known by many names but those who know it as the \"fairy flower\" might be the most prepared to withstand its strong, sweetly scented allure. According to British folklore, a blooming bluebell carpet on the woodland floor is a mystical place where fairies live. The legends hold that fairies hang their spells on the flowers to dry, and disturbing them would unleash the magic. In earlier times, children were warned that picking bluebells would cause them to be spirited away. Even adults could fall victim to the flower, being doomed to wander the woods and never escape. And heaven forbid you ever happen to hear the fairies ring the bluebells for their gatherings—it means your death is imminent, a belief that inspired another name for bluebells: \"dead men\"s bells.\""

Kings can be found in Antarctica and on the subantarctic islands, but their only visits to shore are during the breeding season and when it\"s time to molt. The 3-foot-tall kings have one of the longest breeding seasons for birds: It lasts from 14 to 15 months, and they only raise one chick every other year, as it takes nine months for the baby to be fully fledged."

The year was split into just two seasons back then—summer and winter—which explains why Sumardagurinn Fyrsti, the First Day of Summer, falls in chilly April. Indeed, folklore has it that if you put a dish of water outside the night before the holiday and it freezes, you\"ll have a good summer. Regardless of temperature, the holiday does herald the arrival of those famously long days with little darkness, a welcome relief after the light-deprived winter months."

The big attraction is the series of 16 descending, turquoise-colored lakes, connected by subterranean karst rivers, and above ground by streams and waterfalls. The lakes are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is created by the interplay of water, plant material, and bacteria. The water changes color from green to azure to gray depending on the angle of the light and the density of minerals and organisms in the water. About 11 miles of wooden boardwalk make it easy for people to wander among the lakes, falls, and caves that are open to visitors year-round."

Square Tower House is one of many cliff dwellings constructed by the Ancestral Puebloans in what is now the American Southwest. At 27 feet, it\"s the tallest structure in the park. Square Tower House is also notable for its kiva, a round, sunken room used for ceremonies. Unlike most of the ancient kivas found in the region, the kiva at Square Tower House has an intact original clay roof supported by wooden beams."

Completed and staged 16 months after Christo\"s death at age 84, \"Wrapped\" was the fruition of an idea 60 years in the making. On view for 16 days from Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021, the project required 270,000 square feet of recyclable silvery-blue polypropylene fabric that completely covered the monument. The fabric glistened and glimmered with the changing light of Paris. The pleated fabric was held fast to the arch by nearly 2 miles of red rope."

Scientifically, the beautiful view exists thanks to something called an \"entrenched meander.\" Around 6 million years ago, the area was closer to sea level. The Colorado River, following the path of least resistance, meandered and became trapped when the Colorado Plateau uplifted around 5 million years ago. Over time, the river water cut through exposed sandstone, forming the thousand-foot-deep, 270-degree horseshoe-shaped bend."

No wonder, then, that it\"s also known as the Oriental paperbush.

While historical fact and fiction can diverge, we do know that before March 15, 44 BCE was over, a group of senators had intercepted Caesar here in the Forum as Caesar was on his way to the Senate House. They stabbed him 23 times, killing him. Afterward, Rome descended into civil war, ending the Roman Republic, and leading to the rise of the Roman Empire."

The first American troop had 18 girls participating. Low designed activities to allow girls to serve their communities, experience the outdoors, and develop self-reliance and resourcefulness. Those skills would be useful on the camping expedition seen in today\"s photo. These girls can be seen along the shore of Todd Lake at the Deschutes National Forest in Oregon in 1960."

The artist then used a broom to further remove the snow from his footprints and reveal the lines of the flower nearly 200 feet across. Uy\"s piece was fully visible only when the sun was low.

These rivers are themselves fed by the melted waters of glaciers in the nearby Southern Alps. As these active glaciers slowly bulldoze the mountainsides, they pulverize rocks along valley floors and walls. All that grinding eventually produces a fine-grained powder of silt, sometimes called glacial flour. Meltwater picks up the silt, carrying it downstream and into lakes like Tekapo. The particles are so light and fine, they\"re slow to sink to the bottom, remaining suspended in the water column instead."

        "description": "Love is in the air on Llanddwyn Island at the southern tip of Anglesey, a much bigger island just off the northwest coast of Wales. Each year on January 25, Cupid aims his arrow toward the people of Wales who celebrate St. Dwynwen\"s Day—the Welsh version of St. Valentine\"s Day. St. Dwynwen is Wales\" patron saint of lovers, although she was rather unlucky in that department after falling head over heels for a man she wasn\"t allowed to marry. The 5th-century princess\"s heartache led her to dedicate her life to God and pray for true lovers to have better fortune than her own. In return, Dwynwen became a nun and set up a convent here on Llanddwyn."

        "description": "December 26 isn\"t just a day for Santa to put his feet up and sleep off all those mince pies. In many British Commonwealth countries, today is known as Boxing Day, a holiday that originated in the United Kingdom. There are a few conflicting theories about its origins, but it\"s generally accepted that the name derives from the giving of \"boxes\" to lower classes on the day after Christmas. One thing is certain—it has nothing to do with pugilism, although it has primarily become a day dedicated to sporting events and shopping, much like the Friday after Thanksgiving in the US."

Instead, its coat transitions from brown and gray to a snowy white every autumn.

Because cheetahs have uniquely flexible spines, they\"re able to make sharp, sudden turns, even during a high-speed chase. Individual cheetahs tend to avoid one another, but a cub like this one will stay with its mother for about 18 months, and a female cub may stick with mom into adulthood.

The unusual prop has practical origins. The Zuni people have thrived in the Zuni River Valley in New Mexico for 4,000 years, and their handmade clay ollas have long been used to store food and water. A practical—if tricky—way for a Zuni woman to carry a heavy jar of water back home was to balance it on her head. Over time, the women began incorporating this skill into their dances, thus the formation of the Zuni Olla Maidens."

Just don\"t call them gargoyles (for that title to apply, they\"d need waterspouts)! Statues like these fellas bear an even more Halloween-appropriate name: grotesques."

In Chinese mythology, they\"re blamed for bad weather, while Celts associated them with warfare. In some Native American traditions ravens are often represented as mischievous tricksters, while many European cultures associate them with evil spirits, usually of demonic origin. In English, a gathering of ravens like this is even called an \"unkindness\"!"

At the same time, it forced travel restrictions that made shipping more complicated.

Many flowers have evolved funnel-shaped blooms specifically to attract hummingbirds—large insects like bumblebees can’t always squeeze into these tubular blossoms. But hummingbirds can plunge their long, narrow bills deep into the blooms to find the nectar that accumulates in the base and in the process, they spread pollen from flower to flower."

More than 70 million years ago, this desert was a tidal swamp along the shore of the long-evaporated Western Interior Seaway that once bisected North America. A diverse array of sediment and rock was deposited by the waters, and after the seaway retreated, the rocks remained."

But Sardinians faced myriad logistical issues trying to export the zinc, lead, and other minerals that were in high demand. Miners on the island were using modern techniques to extract more and more ore, but it wasn\"t until 1924, when engineer Cesare Vecelli designed and built the mining infrastructure along the cliffs in Porto Flavia, that getting ore off the island matched their ability to extract it."

The five-arch concrete bridge was completed in 1940 just as World War II was spreading across Europe. By 1941, Italian forces from the Axis powers had invaded this region. Local guerrilla fighters took an extreme measure to keep the Italian army from crossing the Tara River Valley: They blew up one of the arches, making the bridge unpassable and slowing the advancement of the invading forces. The bridge was rebuilt in 1946, and though it retains its original name, some still call it the anti-fascist bridge. And now you know an awesome story about a bridge in Montenegro."

But if volcanoes are what you\"re looking for, you\"ll have to make your way to Mount Mayon on the Philippine island of Luzon. The glowing lava you see is on the tip of what many consider to be the world\"s most perfectly shaped, symmetrical volcanic cone. Mount Mayon has erupted dozens of times in the past 400 years, and there was a significant eruption as recently as 2018. Even this year, white steam plumes and a faint crater glow are sometimes visible. Mayon is the most active volcano in an island nation full of active volcanos. It\"s located inside the UNESCO Albay Biosphere Reserve as well as in the Philippine\"s Mayon Volcano Natural Park. Despite its active status, tourists still flock to the park to view the unique beauty of this cone-shaped spectacle."

Instead, once the sea swallow ingests the blue button\"s poison, it stores the venom in the tips of its own feather-like fingers called papillae. Would-be predators should think twice before biting the sea swallow. The poison concentrated in its papillae can kill a predator in seconds. If you come across either of these creatures washed ashore, don\"t touch! While the stings aren\"t deadly to humans, they can cause skin irritation."

The adults develop deep blue plumage, sometimes sporting purple feathers on their heads, and tiptoe around the shoreline on green legs. The chicks are born snowy white, which scientists suggest is a survival adaptation to help them blend in with cattle egrets and snowy egrets—both species with bright white feathers—to enjoy the added safety of being in a large group."

Located at a lofty altitude of about 12,000 feet above sea level, Salar de Uyuni is the world\"s largest salt flat (or salt pan), spanning just over 4,000 square miles. It was formed when prehistoric lakes dried up over centuries, leaving behind a desert of bright white salt that can be seen from space. During the rainy season (December to April), a thin layer of water covering the salt transforms the area into a giant mirror that reflects the beautiful Bolivian skies. If you\"re driving across the surface at such times, it can appear as though you are navigating through a highway of clouds."

Mangroves thrive here at the boundary between land and sea, growing in coastal salt water and low-oxygen conditions where other trees would quickly die. Their complex root systems filter out the salt and form a strong natural defense against storm surges, rising sea levels, and coastal erosion. Mangroves also create aquatic nursery habitats that support a highly diverse range of juvenile fish and crustaceans."

Tree frogs are smaller than your average terrestrial frogs because they spend the majority of their lives perched in trees, and their weight must be fully supported by twigs and leaves. At the rounded ends of their froggy fingers and toes are disc-shaped adhesive pads that help them to maneuver about on trees. While most tree frogs (there are 800 species all over the world!) are green, brown, or gray, these Javans are bright and colorful. This is so they can blend into their jungle environs and avoid notice by predators such as snakes, spiders, bats, and owls."

Most scholars believe it was known to Arab seafarers by the 10th century, but it remained uninhabited until Portuguese sailors established a base on the island in the early 1500s. Mauritius was later colonized in succession by the Netherlands, France, and Great Britain before gaining independence in 1968. Over the years, Mauritius has evolved from a low-income economy based mostly on sugarcane (still one of its biggest exports), to a more diverse one that includes tourism, clothing production, and technology."

The majestic peaks towering over the landscape include Mount Moran, named for Thomas Moran, an American artist of New York\"s Hudson River School who earned fame by painting scenes of the Western frontier. In 1871, Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson  were invited on an expedition to the Yellowstone region to accompany a team from the US Geological Society while they conducted the first comprehensive survey of the area. Moran\"s paintings and Jackson\"s photographs from the trip immediately captured the public\"s attention and inspired Congress to establish Yellowstone as the first national park in 1872."

Commonly called spiral aloe, it\"s a coveted garden plant with specific growing conditions that make it hard to keep alive.

It\"s especially notable for the many birds: Over 280 species are found here, including storks, kingfishers, cormorants, and eagles, as well as one of the world\"s largest reserves of black vultures and their tawny vulture cousins. Other wildlife routinely spotted in Monfragüe include otters, deer, wild boar, and Iberian lynx."

Surrounded by snow-capped mountains just out of frame, Lucerne lies in the German-speaking part of central Switzerland and is divided into two parts linked by a series of bridges. The most famous of these bridges—the centerpiece and symbol of Lucerne—is the Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge), a covered wooden footbridge that you can see spanning diagonally across the Reuss in our photo. The building rising from the river alongside the footbridge is a medieval water tower, which has been used as a prison, torture chamber, local archive, and treasury."

        "description": "It takes some effort to reach the stunning Nā Pali Coast on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Located on the island\"s northwest side and stretching about 16 miles, Nā Pali isn\"t accessible by car. You have to hike in, fly in by helicopter, or come at it from the sea by boat. In the summer, when the waves are calm, you can explore the rugged coast by kayak, but you\"ll need a solid supply of muscle power for the sometimes-grueling paddle. If you seek a gentler approach—and if COVID restrictions allow—book a boat trip to explore the interiors of the sea caves that dot the shore. Today, we\"re looking down on the Bright Eye sea cave, one of several caves on the Nā Pali Coast that lost their ceilings to the pounding of the sea."

They live throughout the world\"s subtropical waters, and like other sea turtles, they migrate long distances for food. Despite all that traveling, they return to hatch their eggs on the same select nesting beaches where they were born."

That\"s because about 2,000 brown bears can be found freely roaming the taiga—or boreal forest—which covers most of the country, making this rugged wilderness in northern Europe the perfect place to see these majestic animals in their natural habitat. And bear watching is a popular pastime in Finland. The bear-watching season begins in April—when the first bears emerge from hibernation in a white blanket of snow—and lasts until fall. Summer nights are the best time to spot the bears, even under the golden glow of the midnight sun for those who venture north of the Arctic Circle. Many observe the creatures from the safety of a \"hide,\" a purpose-built wooden cabin offering visitors a close-up view of a real teddy bear\"s picnic."

But the never-ending pier proved so popular, the city now opens the bridge to circular meandering each spring and summer."

Thanks to conservation efforts, their numbers have now risen to more than 600. While that\"s good news, this limited recovery is still fragile, and these incredible creatures remain imperiled, particularly by the loss of their wetland habitat."

Probably because it\"s so smooth, no one is known to have climbed the rock until 1954, when a small group of friends scaled it by wedging a series of boards into a vertical crack.

But all that love is more than a gesture of affection, as newborn sea otter pups can\"t swim. A pup is totally dependent for about six months, so mom will carry it around on her stomach like you see here. When the little one does venture into the water on its own, mom will rub the pup to fluff its coat, which causes the fur to retain air bubbles, insulating it from chilly water and causing the youngster to float like a cork."

        "description": "Happy International Design Day! It\"s been said the best designs are the ones you never notice, but this giant yellow polka-dotted pumpkin on Japan\"s Naoshima Island is kind of hard to miss. The sculpture is the work of Yayoi Kusama, an avant-garde artist active since the 1950s and known for crafting outlandish, repeating patterns in bright colors. Polka dots and pumpkins are her most famous motifs, showing up not only on her sculptures but in her paintings, performance pieces, and films."

In fact, the animated duo\"s notorious affinity for the local curd—which Wallace likes because producers thought saying it makes his face look \"nice and toothy\"—became so widespread that it helped the Wensleydale cheesemakers stave off bankruptcy."

The castle was originally designed as a fortress, but it also served as a summer residence for Frederick and rulers who followed him."

Robinson endured racist resistance throughout his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers, but the national pastime\"s color barrier was broken, and other players followed him within months. In 1997, Major League Baseball retired Robinson\"s number, 42, across all teams, and in 2004 it began the annual April 15 observance of Jackie Robinson Day.

Because the trees, some planted over 1,300 years ago, grow at different elevations, the cherry blossom front gradually moves up the mountain in a slow, fragrant wave as the season progresses. Peak bloom usually arrives between early and mid-April. Most years, crowds wander through the town of Yoshino, visiting its traditional temples and shrines, before admiring the profusion of cherry blossoms, a custom known as hanami. Of course, we can practice hanami virtually with pictures. But if you\"re lucky enough to have a blooming cherry tree near you, we encourage you to pause and breathe the moment in."

Straddling the southern Colorado-Utah border, Hovenweep is so remote that almost no artificial light disturbs the view of star-filled skies. The dazzling nightscapes are little different from those seen by the Ancestral Puebloans who built these towers. They were a farming culture who first settled in the area roughly 1,100 years ago. By the late 1200s they numbered around 2,500 people and had built these and other structures in six different villages. Archaeologists offer several theories to explain the use of the buildings. Some may have been defensive fortifications, storage areas, homes, or any combination of these. But researchers suggest that the tower called Hovenweep Castle, seen here, was almost certainly used as a celestial observatory."

The 43 events included a marathon, tennis, cycling, fencing, shooting, Greco-Roman wrestling, and swimming. And while some things haven\"t changed over the years, some were pretty different back then. Swimmers were taken out to sea by boat for the longer races and had to swim back to shore.

        "description": "From the air, the mesmerizing tapestry of sandy dunes and lagoons you see here gives Lençóis Maranhenses National Park an otherworldly, desert-like appearance. Located in the sparsely populated northeast corner of Brazil, this park gets far too much annual rainfall—nearly 50 inches—to be considered a desert. In fact, heavy rain is part of what makes this place unique: Nearly 70% of its annual rainfall comes between January and May, filling the park\"s nearly 40,000 lagoons to the brim with fresh rainwater. Why doesn\"t the water sink into the sand? A layer of impermeable bedrock beneath the dunes prevents that from happening."

        "description": "…Because they\"re so good at it. Although none are as skilled at self-concealment as this specimen from the Loxodonta genus of African elephants—namely the species laprofolis, better known as the common chia elephant. While it\"s the well-known habit of other pachyderms to paint their toenails red and hide in cherry trees, the chia elephant\"s defense is even more unique: After a nice roll in the mud, the elephant charges through patches of seeding chia plants, picking up thousands of seeds that stick on its grooved hide. In under a week—just add water!—the seeds sprout and develop into dense, leafy growths that allow the elephant to conveniently camouflage itself as it wanders the savanna. The curious creature has even been reported to disguise itself as a houseplant, duping homeowners into hosting a literal elephant in the room."

The sea stacks fronting the beach are known as Reynisdrangar and were formed when a volcano erupted, spewing flowing lava that cooled into these formations.

These two traits help the iconic species survive in the rugged mountains and uplands of northern Europe and Asia—this hare is dashing across a heath in the Scottish Highlands. When they have to, these speedy leporids can dart away as fast as 50 mph, at least for short distances, allowing them to outrun predators and disappear safely into the heather. But a would-be predator may not even spy them to begin with—mountain hares change coats, or molt, several times a year, their fur going from brown and gray in summer, to white-gray in winter, helping them to blend into their surroundings whatever the season."

        "description": "A satellite view of the Mania River in Madagascar allows us to see a curious cloud pattern. It\"s common for cool, moist marine air to rise and form dense clouds over bodies of water, then for the clouds to evaporate as they drift over warmer, drier land. The opposite is happening here: Puffs of clouds are forming over land, but not over water. That\"s because Madagascar\"s tropical rainforests are warm and wet enough that evaporating moisture rises as the day heats up. When it rises high enough, the moisture encounters cooler air, which condenses the water into clouds. Generally speaking, clouds will form where the air is rising, which in this case is only over the land. Above the river, the air is cooler and descending, so no clouds are forming there."

But she wasn\"t just a conductor—during the Civil War, she worked as a spy and a nurse, and she led the Combahee River Raid which set free 700 slaves.

Located in Delray Beach, Florida, and created on 50 acres of wastewater utility property, the park first opened to the public back in 1996. A three-quarter-mile boardwalk takes visitors over ponds and through marshes, offering the chance to see more than 150 bird species, plus turtles, fish, frogs, alligators, and other Floridian fauna. Every day, the Palm Beach County Water Utilities Department pumps about 2 million gallons of highly treated wastewater into the wetlands. Then algae and other plants naturally finish the purification process before the water seeps back into the water table. Quite an upgrade from a yucky wastewater pond."

This unusual chemical makeup may or may not be a result of the area\"s long history of mining, which dates back at least 5,000 years. Ancient residents like the Tartessians and Romans dug here for copper, silver, and gold, as well as the mineral pyrite, commonly referred to as \"fool\"s gold.\" Legend has it that the Rio Tinto was the site of the fabled mines of King Solomon."

For this sculpture, by artist Elizabeth Catlett, was inspired by Ellison\"s most famous written work, \"Invisible Man,\" published in 1952. The lyrical, uncompromising novel is narrated by an unnamed Black man who describes his agonizing search for identity in a society largely hostile to African Americans and blind to the suffering and indignities of the Black experience. The sculpture bears an inscription of the novel\"s opening words: \"I am an invisible man…I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.\" Widely recognized as one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century, \"Invisible Man\" won the National Book Award in 1953 and remains one of the most searing portraits of modern American life."

There are dozens of species of parrotfish and they live in abundant numbers in the world\"s tropical seas. These thick-bodied fish have large scales and a beak of fused teeth they use to diligently scrape delicious algae from reefs and rocks. Some also eat coral, which they grind up with plate-like teeth in their throats. Researchers say parrotfish play a critical role in the health of coral reefs by eating algae that can choke off coral growth. They also help replenish the white sandy beaches near these tropical reefs. How? After parrotfish digest the edible parts of coral, they excrete what\"s left as sand—a lot of sand. In some species, a single parrotfish can poop almost 1,000 pounds of pearly white sand each year. But never mind that—some trivia is best not to dwell on."

California produces around 80% of the world\"s almonds and booming demand means production has more than doubled in the past few years, despite threats from drought and wildfires."

        "description": "When the sky is clear, and the moon hangs low in the horizon, you can sometimes spot a halo around it, like the one captured in this image from Hug Point Falls on the Oregon coast. And occasionally within that halo, you may also see a bright spot that appears to be a second moon. No, it\"s not the moon\"s long-lost twin, but an optical phenomenon called a paraselene, more commonly referred to as a moon dog or mock moon. This \"false\" moon can appear when the real moon is at least a quarter visible and is bright enough for its light to refract off hexagonal plate-shaped ice crystals floating in the atmosphere. Moon dogs are more commonly seen in winter months, when ice crystals are more prevalent in the clouds."

An Alabama native, Lewis moved to Atlanta in 1963. He was already famous and would become even more so for leading marches, protests, and sit-ins throughout the South. Beaten by police, the KKK, and angry mobs, Lewis never wavered from his belief in nonviolent protest. He famously fought with his voice and peaceful actions, never his fists."

They generally live in pine and fir forests with meadows nearby, hunting small rodents at night and avoiding areas with people. Great grays hunt by listening and watching from a perch, then swooping down on their prey—sometimes plunging into more than a foot of snow to make a diving catch."

That\"s because when British people first named it the redbreast, probably in the 1400s, the word \"orange\" had not yet been introduced as a color name in the English language. Animals and other things were often named \"red\" even when orange or tawny: the red deer, Red Planet, and robin redbreast are all examples.

A subspecies of the gray wolf, the Arctic wolf lives in the extreme north of Canada\"s Queen Elizabeth Islands. It\"s extremely cold there, but an advantage of this habitat is that the remoteness has kept the Arctic wolf population from being hunted extensively. It is currently the only wolf species not endangered or threatened. We\"re featuring this handsome trio because tonight will be the Wolf Moon, traditionally the first full moon of the year. The name comes to us by way of the Algonquin people to denote the time of year that hungry wolves could be heard howling outside their settlements."

Well, not usually, but for the Indigenous Guna people of Panama, the colorful handwoven textiles seen here may be an exception. Molas, which means \"clothing\" in the Guna language, are traditionally displayed on both the front and back of women\"s blouses. Even today, many Guna women prefer to wear them instead of modern attire. The textiles often feature abstract geometric patterns, as well as images from nature such as turtles, flowers, birds, and fish. Guna women of yesteryear were known to paint their bodies with those same geometric patterns and designs, and by the late 1800s they had begun weaving them onto cloth instead of painting themselves. Today, the production of molas is still generally done by women, who use an intricate process called reverse appliqué, where as many as seven layers of fabric are sewn together to form a panel, which is then hand-cut to create the vibrant designs."

Potter based Nutkin on the red squirrel, the only native squirrel species in the UK. The red squirrel population saw a steep decline here after humans introduced the larger nonnative Eastern gray squirrel in the late 1800s. But today in the UK, the red squirrel is a protected species, bolstering efforts to keep the gray numbers in check and preserve habitat. Estimates put the red squirrel population in the UK at fewer than 140,000, with the vast majority living in the woods of Scotland, like our little friend here."

At its height, around 1,200 years ago, the city of Calakmul had a population of about 50,000 people, but the kingdom as a whole numbered more than 1.5 million. Archaeologists have uncovered 6,750 structures here—the largest is this pyramid temple, called, simply, \"Structure 2.\" It\"s one of the tallest and most massive remaining structures from that highly advanced culture. The ruins of the city proper cover nearly 8 square miles in the jungle and the kingdom once ruled over settlements as far as 90 miles away."

King referred to written notes for most of the speech, but as he neared the end of his prepared remarks, he heard gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, who was standing nearby, shout out, \"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\" King responded by partly improvising the rest of his message in a soaring, sermon-like delivery, punctuating his ideas repeatedly with that single phrase, \"I have a dream.\" King\"s dream for racial justice, so eloquently shared that day, would resonate through the crowd and across the nation, bringing passionate new energy to the civil rights movement.

Agoyán, better known as El Pailón del Diablo (The Devil\"s Cauldron), is Ecuador\"s tallest and most famous waterfall. It\"s a highlight of the Ruta de las Cascadas (Route of the Waterfalls), a popular circuit of the many waterfalls and hot springs near the mountain town of Baños de Agua Santa."

There are other glass-domed hotels to choose from in Lapland, but the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, shown here, is the most famous. Visitors come to view the aurora borealis, or northern lights, and for various outdoor sports. There\"s cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, downhill skiing, dogsledding, and even reindeer-drawn sleigh rides to keep you entertained during the short winter days. Evenings are spent dining (yes, reindeer may be on the menu), warming up in the sauna, and for some, sleeping under the stars and the swirling, hypnotic northern lights."

At various times of the year, it can turn the shade of tomato soup due to microscopic red algae and sediments. During the rainy season from December to April, scores of flamingos flock to the area to dip their comb-like bills into the water to filter out delicious plankton and algae. You can find three of the six types of flamingos here—the Chilean, Andean, and the world\"s largest population of the endangered James\"s flamingo, once thought to be extinct."

As a prime example of Moroccan earthen clay architecture, Aït Benhaddou has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987. It\"s no longer teeming with the large numbers of people who once lived there. But there are small markets and a few families within the city who cater to the visitors who come to walk its historic streets. As a symbol of Morocco\"s enduring history, Aït Benhaddou would be a fine place to reflect upon the events of January 11, 1944, when Moroccan nationalists issued a public proclamation calling for the independence of their country, an audacious action that sparked the movement that would end colonialism by 1956."

But that mane also retains venom from the slug\"s prey—sea anemones—treating any would-be devourers to a painful sting. Should a ravenous sea star disregard these defenses and get too close for comfort, the Spanish shawl has a Plan B: By flapping its whole 2- to 3-inch body like a gelatinous wing, the nudibranch can flutter into open water for a quick escape."

He conducted his first experiments 170 years ago, in early January 1851, with a relatively small prototype in the cellar of his home. Just a month later, Foucault performed his most famous pendulum demonstration, using a 62-pound spherical weight attached to a 220-foot wire, which was hung from the dome of the Panthéon, a Parisian monument. As the pendulum swung back and forth in a fixed plane, the pointed end of the weight traced lines in a compass-like circle of sand below it. As time passed, the angle of these lines began to change, demonstrating to onlookers that the Earth itself was rotating underneath the pendulum, and by extension, everyone watching was rotating as well, spinning on the surface of the great blue marble around its axis."

The yellow neo-Gothic castle that Maximilian built to replace the earlier ruins became the summer home and hunting retreat for the king, his wife, Marie of Prussia, and their two sons, Ludwig and Otto.

This gives it protection, but a rigid body (like a candy cane!), so it swims by rapidly fanning its fins. Also like the seahorse, it\"s the male pipefish—not the female—who carries the eggs. After an elaborate courtship dance, the female deposits her eggs in the male\"s brood pouch, where they develop until the male gives birth.

They then grouped them into the stone circle at Castlerigg, seen here casting shadows from the low winter sun. Archeologists believe stone circles were arranged to align with solar and lunar positions. They were used in elaborate rituals to celebrate occasions like today\"s winter solstice, the shortest day (and longest night) of the year in the Northern Hemisphere."

        "description": "Native to North America, mountain goats spend much of the year scaling peaks from south-central Alaska down to the northern Rockies. They tend to live at high altitudes, often above 13,000 feet, where their sure-footed climbing ability allows them to clamber up extraordinarily steep, rocky slopes. In the winter, they\"ll migrate down to slightly lower elevations to seek shelter in subalpine forests with south-facing rocky ledges, where the sun and relentless winds keep ice to a minimum. Here, they forage for lichen, mosses, grasses, and other greens. Their woolly, two-layered coats keep them toasty as temperatures dip, which is probably why even in the chill of western Montana this young mountain goat—or kid—appears to be having a ball. Enjoying winter is all about how you dress."

According to the story, four sisters saved their people using a magic mirror to turn themselves into the mountain to imprison the devil. The tallest peak, named \"Peak of the Youngest Sister,\" stands at 20,500 feet and is an extremely challenging climb—it\"s rarely attempted and wasn\"t summitted until 1981. The national park includes three valleys flanking the mountain and is part of the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In addition to giant pandas, the sanctuary is home to the red panda, the snow leopard, the clouded leopard, and between 5,000 and 6,000 species of plants."

It plays a crucial role in the trees\" lifecycle but has also served as a potent symbol for a variety of human cultures. In many traditions, it\"s been associated with fertility and enlightenment, appearing in art from the Mayans, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. That association comes from its main job—making baby trees. The ornate, woody pine cones shown here are females, and they\"re designed to create and protect seeds. Male cones, which are usually smaller, produce pollen. The female cones open and close their scales to allow for pollination and eventually release their seeds onto the forest floor. But pine cones also open and close in response to changes in the weather, making them a natural barometer."

The action took place during World War II at England\"s Bletchley Park, a country estate that served as a top-secret facility. An assembled team, including the pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, developed this device, known as a Bombe machine. It was instrumental in cracking the Germans\" \"uncrackable\" Enigma code, which was used for encrypting secret messages in German war operations. The Enigma code was itself generated by a rotor-driven machine that re-scrambled the code each day—so the Bombe mirrored those mechanics to keep up with the changing encryption. Insights the Bombe and other programmable machines provided into enemy military plans helped to speed the Allies\" eventual triumph—some even argue that the codebreakers\" efforts won the war."

These fortifications made clear that Rocca Calascio was ready for any military rivals who might scale the slopes from the valley below to attack this garrison. The fight never came. The ruins you see here are not battle scars but the result of a powerful earthquake. By the early 1700s, Rocca Calascio was abandoned, but it can still claim the title of highest fortress in the Apennines—and some of the most spectacular views in all of Italy. In fact, filmmakers have chosen the site for several movies, including \"The Name of the Rose\" and \"Ladyhawke.\""

An iconic symbol of Scotland, from the 14th to 18th centuries the castle was mostly held by the Mackenzies and defended by the MacRaes, both storied clans of the Scottish Highlands. The castle was destroyed in 1719 by the invading British Royal Navy during the Jacobite Uprising, but was rebuilt along its earlier design in the early 20th century by Lt.

If you prefer your adventure to take place on dry land, there are over 700 miles of trails to hike within the park—perfect for burning off those turkey and pumpkin-pie calories."

Though Siberian pine nuts are a favorite meal, these little rodents will eat nearly anything—seeds, fruits, insects, even small birds and lizards. Our ravenous friend here in Hokkaido, Japan, is gorging on inflorescences, or clusters of flowers.  A chipmunk can stuff a surprising amount of goodies into its cheek pouches, which can stretch to three times its head size—imagine how ridiculous we\"d look if our stomachs were as forgiving."

        "description": "In the late 18th century, a wealthy landowner built an estate in County Antrim in what is now Northern Ireland. To make a scenic but imposing entryway, he had 150 beech trees planted on either side of the road (90 trees survive). The trees grew to form the Dark Hedges—an arboreal tunnel leading up to the property. In the right conditions—say a gloomy autumn night with the moonlight casting shadows through the tree canopy—this road can be a little spooky."

Experts estimate only a few thousand of these elusive birds remain, scattered in pockets of dense old-growth forests in northern Japan, the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and potentially North Korea."

Though scientists still don\"t quite understand how the individual starlings in a murmuration coordinate their tight, fluid formations, the behavior is thought to be a way to confuse predators."

It was here on this day in 1867 that officials of the Russian Empire formally transferred the Territory of Alaska to the United States in a sale for $7.2 million, or just around 2 cents per acre. It seems an astonishingly small price today, but at the time, opponents called it \"Seward\"s Folly\" after then-Secretary of State William H. Seward, who negotiated the deal. Few Americans moved to the \"Last Frontier\" at first, but in the 1890s, when gold was discovered in the Yukon and Alaska, a rush of prospectors and others began a wave of settlers in the territory. Ever since, Alaska, with its vast natural resources and staggering beauty, has been a prized American domain and an enduring symbol of American wilderness."

The planet\"s innermost moon, Io, is captured in a true-color composite image during one of its frequent volcanic eruptions. A close look will show lava is glowing red beneath the blue and white plume of particles being ejected into the moon\"s thin atmosphere."

This makes the fish relatively easy pickings for hungry bears, who can catch up to 30 salmon a day."

Its slender, tapered body is propelled through the water with agility and grace by a long tail fin that sweeps from side to side. Listed as \"near threatened,\" blue sharks are found off the coast of every continent except for Antarctica, making them the most widely distributed of all sharks. Swift and powerful swimmers, blue sharks migrate long distances. It\"s common for them to swim 1,200 to 1,700 miles or even farther, following the clockwise currents of the Gulf Stream in search of food, mates, and \"just right\" water temperatures."

The air insulates the pup from chilly water and sometimes causes the youngster to float like a cork. Sea otters can survive on land, but they spend most of their time in the water, sleeping above the surface and anchoring themselves with kelp—or by holding onto each other. When they get hungry, they use rocks as tools to hunt food and pry open shells—something that makes them relatively unique, as they\"re one of the few animal species that can use tools."

After spending spring and summer grazing in the hills and meadows of the Icelandic countryside, the nation\"s many sheep—all members of a distinct breed—are brought home to their ranches to avoid the harsh winter weather. It\"s not an easy task—ranchers and Icelandic sheepdogs endeavor to bring the often stubborn sheep in, and then they must sort them so they go back to their respective owners. When the sheep are all secure at their home ranches, people customarily celebrate with music, dancing, drinks, and food. In recent years, the event has attracted tourists interested in seeing this collaborative undertaking in action, but of course, even in the Icelandic countryside, social events like réttir celebrations will be a bit more subdued this year."

The national holiday commemorates the end of three historic sieges made on the Maltese archipelago—the Great Siege of Malta, which took place in 1565; the Siege of Valletta by the French, which ended in 1800; and the Siege of Malta during the Second World War by German and Italian forces. The WWII Siege of Malta ended in 1942, after nearly two and a half years of devastating air attacks. King George VI of the United Kingdom, which then ruled the island, awarded Malta the George Cross \"for the heroism and devotion of its people\" during the great siege. The George Cross was incorporated into the flag of Malta in 1943 and remains there today."

In this case, a worker is applying a fresh coat of paint to the Hammering Man, a symbol of laborers everywhere. Hammering Man is a series of sculptures in varying sizes that depict a man with a motorized arm swinging a hammer in a slow, steady motion. American artist Jonathan Borofsky says he created the sculptures as tribute to working-class men and women around the world, and with that in mind, Hammering Man is our Labor Day hero."

The Hamptons is a collection of villages and hamlets with plenty of sandy beachfront that have long been a popular upscale summer destination for New Yorkers looking to escape the city. This year, that migration started early, as city dwellers headed east in the spring in search of space to social distance. In summer, the beaches, of course, are the main attraction, but the area is also known for dining and nightlife (complete with celebrity spotting), wineries, and family-owned farms and farm stands. And the end of summer isn\"t all bad news, at least for the local economy. As temperatures cool and crowds (usually) thin out, the farms shift gears to apple cider and pumpkins, and by November, the harvesting of Peconic Bay scallops begins."

While the \"château\" never gained fame defending the ancient port (since it was never attacked), it did become notorious as a prison. Surrounded by treacherous currents—like Alcatraz in San Francisco—starting in the late 16th century it was a dumping ground for political and religious prisoners. As far as official records go, none of the prisoners condemned there ever escaped."

Spotted Lake is an endorheic lake, which is a basin where water collects but has no river or sea to drain into. The water level rises with rainfall during autumn and winter, but when the days grow hotter and drier in the summertime, the water evaporates and the surface of the lake lowers. It\"s during these hot, dry summers in the Okanagan when Spotted Lake earns its name—large \"spots\" in varying hues of blue, green, or yellow become more prominent as the water level drops. The area\"s closed to the public, but you can get a decent view from the highway. Binoculars recommended."

Unlike most owls, burrowing owls nest and roost underground, often in tunnels abandoned by ground squirrels or prairie dogs. It\"s one of many traits that make the pint-sized species unique among owls. Burrowing owls live in grasslands, deserts, or other open dry areas with low vegetation. When threatened, they retreat to their burrows and are known to frighten off predators by mimicking the rattling and hissing sounds of a rattlesnake. And while most other owls sleep during the daytime, burrowing owls are often active in the daylight hours. It\"s as if they didn\"t finish proper owl training."

Beginning around 9,000 years ago and continuing into the 20th century, the caves were further carved and expanded by these human occupants into an elaborate settlement. It\"s now called the Sassi di Matera, a pair of districts in the city of Matera, Italy."

The young cats may be cute and cuddly now, but they\"ll soon grow up to be one of the most powerful and majestic animals in the world. The predominant predator in the region, Kalahari lions cover vast territories spanning harsh shrublands and desert. As prey becomes scarcer, Kalahari lions travel in smaller prides and often cover longer distances in search of their next meal. As of 2015, lions were listed as vulnerable and placed on the World Conservation Union Red List of Threatened Species. World Lion Day supports and promotes organizations and conservation efforts that address the dwindling wild lion population."

The park also includes acres of mud pots, hot springs, steam vents, and fumaroles to remind you of the heat that\"s below you, including Boiling Springs Lake—one of the largest boiling lakes in the world at over 500 feet wide."

In honor of Oyster Day, August 5 of each year, we\"re getting a glimpse of just one method of oyster mariculture, or farming in open seawater. The briny bivalves may be grown on beds, rods, racks, or—in this case—ropes, but the basic process is simple: Growing surfaces are \"seeded\" with whole or ground oyster shells before oyster larvae are introduced. The shells attract the larvae, which attach themselves and soon grow into a new layer of mature oysters. Humans have been doing this at least since the days of ancient Rome, but wild-picked oysters have been an important food source to many cultures since prehistory."

        "description": "You\"re forgiven if this is the first you\"re hearing of National Moth Week, even though it\"s been going strong for eight years as a global call to learn about and observe the fuzzy little insects. All too often dismissed as pesky, drab counterparts to our brightly fluttering friends the butterflies, moths seem to hog every light but the spotlight. But they don\"t need flashy marketing to win the numbers game: With an estimated 160,000 moth species (though some estimates go up to half a million), they vastly outnumber their swaggering butterfly cousins in the Lepidoptera order."

The forest features a mix of conifers and deciduous trees draped heavily with moss, like the arching big leaf maple in our homepage image. A stroll through the forest will also reveal the massive Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees that may reach more than 300 feet up into the dense canopy. Below, the woods teem with ferns, lichen, and other vegetation. It\"s an enchanted forest right out of a fairy tale."

It is intermediate between land and sky.\" So Henry David Thoreau immortalized Walden Pond, but he could have been describing this calming image of Ežezers Lake in Latvia. Today, the birthday of that famous American advocate for pursuing a simple life is also National Simplicity Day, an annual reminder to unplug, slow down, step back, and consider your life. Thoreau\"s most famous work (that you probably haven\"t read since high school), \"Walden,\" is his account of the two years, two months, and two days he spent away from society in a cabin near the shore of Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. Through this work he encourages us to take a step back and look for ways to simplify our lives. \"Our life is frittered away by detail,\" Thoreau observed. \"Simplify, simplify.\""

Mangrove forests like Bàu Cá Cái in coastal Vietnam\"s Quảng Ngãi province are an important shield against destructive typhoons that rock the coast each year. Unfortunately, mangrove trees have been depleted over the years by population growth, climate change, and increased use of waters for fish farming. Plantings at Bàu Cá Cái—outlined by bamboo frames to create the neat patterns seen here—have been part of a major initiative to regenerate nearly 10,000 acres of mangrove forest around the country."

Until the mid-20th century, this site in the Italian Alps was home to the village of Graun, which included some 163 homes. But then in 1939, an electric company announced plans to build a dam and an artificial lake here, which would submerge Graun and part of the town of Reschen. Despite public outcry and delays due to World War II, the towns were eventually submerged in 1950 (with everyone safely removed, of course). These days, the remaining church steeple draws tourists, especially in winter, when the lake is frozen over and visitors can walk across."

Over 110,000 gray seals, more than 35% of the world\"s population, make their home in and around the coastal waters of the British Isles. As autumn approaches, pupping season begins, and fuzzy pups—like the one photographed here—can be spotted on the coasts and beaches of the eastern Atlantic. About a month after the seal pups are born, they\"re abruptly weaned when their mothers return to the sea to hunt for food and find a new mate. The older pups then congregate for protection in groups called weaner pods. Within weeks they shed their thick pup fur and take to the sea to learn how to catch their own fish."

        "description": "As National Pollinator Week kicks off today, you might ask yourself why a US Senate resolution would officially dedicate a whole week to bees, birds, bats, beetles, and other critters that move pollen from plant to plant. True, on days when your eyes are rubbed red by lunchtime and the Allegra won\"t seem to kick in, you might not think the world of pollen. But in ways that transcend sinus clarity, your world wouldn\"t be the same without pollinators—they\"re to thank for as many as one in three bites of food eaten in the US. Pollinator Week is meant to highlight problems—like climate change, pollution, and invasive species—that threaten pollinator animals, especially bee populations that are already declining."

From day one, both male and female bearded emperor tamarin babies (like the one hitching a ride in this photo), start growing their trademark handlebar mustaches and wispy beards. These diminutive residents of the Amazon basin are highly social animals. Females often give birth to twins and stay pretty busy during the day nursing them. After the babies are fed, the males watch over the youngsters by carrying them around on their backs. By the time the young tamarins reach two months old their pops become the primary caregivers, providing food and showing the ropes of the rainforest to their young charges—where to find fruit and nectar in the dry season, how to leap from branch to branch, and the best ways to groom those outrageous mustaches and beards."

This occurred in Texas—the most remote of the Confederate states—when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay and read federal orders declaring that all enslaved people were free. Once a mostly regional observance, Juneteenth has in recent decades become a much broader celebration of African American freedom. This year in particular, it\"s seen as a way to express support for the African American and Black community during a time of widespread protests against systemic racism and police brutality."

Even with this new industry boosting the local economy over the past few years, Aloguinsan remained an out-of-the-way spot for tourists—larger towns and cities nearby still attracted more visitors. But the remoteness of the Bojo was always part of the selling point: Visitors who made the effort to come take a ride down the river would get taste of the quiet life in the fishing villages along the banks."

The stars were arranged on a blue background to represent a \"new constellation.\" In 1795, two more stars and two stripes were added to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky to the Union. Then in 1818, Congress passed a plan to go back to 13 stripes and add only stars for new states. The current version of the flag has been in effect since 1960, after Hawaii became a state the prior year. The flags we\"re looking at here are flying in New Jersey\"s Liberty State Park, with the Statue of Liberty in the background."

The hardy perennial blooms across North American prairies in the springtime, setting off purple-tinged, closed bell-shaped buds that hang downward in clumps of three. After bees go to work pollinating the buds, the fertilized flowers open and turn skyward transforming their pistils into soft swirling tendrils that are said to resemble an old man\"s whiskers. Take a good look at our image and decide if that\"s what comes to mind for you. As summer marches on, the plants continue their spectacular show as the fuzzy seed heads take on a pink-tinged cast resembling low-lying prairie smoke."

Afternoon thunderstorms are common, bringing heavy rainfalls that subside quickly. The largest subtropical wilderness in the US, the Everglades is essentially a slow-moving river, 60 miles wide and over 100 miles long. The water flows during the wet season from Lake Okeechobee southward across a limestone shelf to the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula. The complex ecosystem here is not found anywhere else on the planet."

While doing this, they\"re also developing the skills they\"ll need to protect themselves and hunt for food. Cheetahs are born with all their spots, but at birth those spots are closer together, giving the cubs a darker appearance that helps them hide from predators. They also have a strip of long fur down the center of their backs called a mantle that helps them blend into the grass. June is an optimal month for wildlife viewing in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area since it\"s the start of the dry season. In addition to cheetahs, visitors can spot lions, hyenas, leopards, jackals, and other animals."

While it was celebrated independently by various towns across the country in the aftermath of the Civil War, Union General John A. Logan was the first to call for a national day of remembrance on May 30, 1868. Originally called Decoration Day, it was a day set aside for the public to offer prayers and honors for those lost to battle and to decorate their graves with flags and flowers. On the first national Decoration Day, over 5,000 widows, orphans, and other mourners attended a ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery, and placed flowers on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers interred there. Originally only a commemoration of those soldiers killed in the Civil War, by the end of WWI it had come to be a holiday honoring all American war casualties from the Revolutionary War onward."

Celtic mazes are a common artistic motif in artifacts from ancient Celtic settlements. Historians suggest the Celtic maze was linked to spiritual practices, often associated with the journey of the dead into the afterlife. And in modern life, they can be an inspiration for creative hedge mazes. Are you rethinking your backyard landscaping, or is that just us?"

Today, Jeff Hanson is a successful artist who only vaguely sees shapes and colors. Although legally blind, he\"s developed a unique tactile process that helps him feel his compositions by first plastering the canvas with a thick plastic goop. Once that hardens, he uses the plastic ridges to navigate a piece, lending the composition form so he can add his signature vibrant color. He playfully calls each painting \"a sight for sore eyes\" and sells his art to appreciators like Warren Buffett, Elton John, and other collectors. Yet, one of the most creative aspects of Hanson\"s life is the way he\"s had to develop assistive methods to paint."

These hard-working insects are key pollinators of flowers, like the sunflowers and lavender seen growing here. That’s why beekeepers have strategically placed these hives near the flower crops. Bees are also critical for the pollination of fruits and vegetables—about a third of the food we eat is a result of honeybee pollination. In the US, honeybees, whether tended by beekeepers or living in the wild, pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops every year. That\"s a lot of gold—and doesn\"t even include their delicious honey. So today on World Bee Day, we invite you to stop and smell the flowers and give a nod to the bees that help color our world."

        "description": "These colorful little eggs are the progeny of the hoary redpoll, also known as the Arctic redpoll because of its extreme northern habitat. This hardy finch spends much of its time, including breeding season, in the brushy tundra of the northern polar regions. Because of the extreme cold, the female will often line her nest with feathers, particularly white ptarmigan feathers, as these appear to be. Sighting a hoary redpoll is a rare treat. The bird doesn\"t exactly migrate, but in winter it will sometimes fly short distances farther south in search of food, so if you live in Minnesota, North Dakota, or Montana, you might get a peek at one on your bird feeder. You’ll recognize a hoary redpoll by its small yellow bill, red cap, dark face, and \"frosty\" white underbody streaked with brown. Or listen for the \"chif chif chif\" of its call."

But pollution, overfishing, and climate change have taken a toll: Their population has declined by about 30% over the last 30 years. Today, there\"s an estimated 1.5 million breeding pairs of rockhoppers. About 1 million of those are southern rockhopper couples, like these, with the northern and eastern subspecies accounting for the rest."

The journey, which biologists have dubbed the \"Path of the Pronghorn,\" covers about 150 miles across government and private lands. Pronghorns have walked this route since prehistoric times, though today, fences, highways, and other unnatural barriers have made the journey more perilous. To mitigate these dangers, wildlife corridors are being constructed over highways and under bridges, offering safer passage for these quintessential symbols of the American West. Conservation efforts like these have helped to make the \"Path of the Pronghorn\" one of the longest migration corridors remaining for large mammals in North America."

It\"s the blustery, unpredictable elements of this time of year that inspired an old Western European folktale that the month of March \"borrowed\" three days from April so that it could indulge in a few final winter-like days. These \"borrowed days\" are the last three days of the month. Perhaps take comfort that it\"s only three days. In some parts of Ireland, March borrowed nine days. That\"s too many days."

Come winter, they pass by again on the swim south. The entire round-trip route clocks in at about 12,000 miles, making gray whales among the longest migrators of the animal kingdom.

But his palette of questions and feelings evolved, expanding into surrealism, epic history, and radical politics.

Polar bears don\"t technically hibernate, but in fall, a pregnant female polar bear will dig a maternity den in the snow (although in some areas it\"ll be under the peat soil). While in her small den, the bear enters a dormant state, sleeping nearly all the time, until she gives birth, usually between November and February. Then in spring she\"ll dig herself out and emerge with her recently arrived cubs. Polar bear cubs stay with their mother for about two years as they learn to survive in the Arctic."

This year’s Women\"s Day observance is particularly meaningful in the United States because 2020 marks 100 years since American women won the right to vote nationwide. That victory was the result of a long, difficult struggle by suffragists—women who faced ridicule, slander, imprisonment, and outright brutality for their efforts to claim the right to vote. These women often drew inspiration from Joan of Arc, who became a feminist symbol of the female warrior for universal rights. In their marches and demonstrations in the early 1900s, suffragists often dressed as Joan and invoked her heroism in defiance of a male-dominated culture."

In the 10th century (though possibly starting up to 5,000 years ago) humans excavated the tuff to create caves and catacombs that could fit thousands of dwellers. Through not only the astonishing ruins but the many \"cave hotels\" hewn into rock in the city of Göreme, the memory of those ingenious city planners lives on."

        "description": "Wintertime brings large numbers of humpback whales to the icy waters off the Norwegian coast, where they feed on herring and krill—and delight whale watchers with powerful leaps, tail-slaps, and glimpses into their underwater world. Male humpbacks are famous for their haunting songs, which can last up to 20 minutes and be heard over great distances underwater. Scientists aren\"t sure why exactly the males sing these ballads, but some theorize it\"s related to courtship. That sounds romantic enough, but ladies take note—the humpback isn\"t one to settle down. It\"s a migratory animal that swims up to 16,000 miles a year, traveling from southern breeding grounds to Arctic waters like these."

This became a key component of his research. The islands are home to thousands of unique species, including this Pinzon Island tortoise, which we see hatching from an egg at the Charles Darwin Research Station."

In winter, the lake draws nature photographers interested not just in the wildlife and spectacular landscape, but also the lake\"s odd appearance when it freezes over. Bacteria on the lake bottom feed on dead organic matter and release the methane bubbles you see here. When the surface water freezes, the bubbles get trapped, creating a photographer\"s dream. They may be beautiful, but these frozen bubbles can be dangerous because they\"re highly flammable. If you happen to be lighting a match nearby, you\"ll want to watch out or the released methane could explode. The bubbles aren\"t so friendly to the environment, either; methane in the atmosphere is a major part of global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change."

The king of Sri Lanka himself, King Kashyapa, who ruled from 473 to 495 CE, once made this the site of his new capital. He ordered that his palace be constructed atop the rock and about halfway up, he had a large gateway carved into the side of the outcropping in the shape of a lion (hence the name). His fortress was abandoned when he died, and the site later served as a monastery. These days it\"s a tourist attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage site."

These statues were toppled in the 18th or 19th century along with other moai island-wide for reasons not fully known to scholars, though earthquakes or possible tribal infighting are postulated. The statues were later buried by a tidal wave and lay in ruins until the 1990s, when they were excavated and placed back on the ahu."

Native to five continents and currently living on six (there\"s no Antarctic squirrel), there are about 285 species of squirrels in the world, ranging from the tiny African pygmy squirrel to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel (when in Bhutan, be ready to duck)."

Among those in the front line of demonstrators are baseball great Jackie Robinson and bus-boycott activist Rosa Parks, both towering figures in the civil rights movement. Later this day, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. would deliver his \"I Have a Dream\" speech in front of a quarter-million protesters packed onto the National Mall. The speech is considered among the best in American history and a defining moment in the fight for civil rights. King was just 34 years old."

The dune field became a national monument on this day in 1933 with a proclamation by President Herbert Hoover, which set aside nearly 150,000 acres for preservation. Recently, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed legislation making it the 62nd designated national park in the National Park System."

While seabirds like the cormorant are a threat to these fish, the mackerel aren\"t exactly defenseless. Fish have many unique means of defense, such as traveling in dense schools like this one. It\"s a technique that not only allows for speedy travel (because it reduces friction on most of the fish in the school)—schooling also makes it more difficult for predators to pick out an individual victim. For these fish, there\"s safety in numbers. But when all else fails, they can take some advice from Dory in \"Finding Nemo\"—\"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\""

Later, the statues showed their appreciation by delivering gifts to the hatmaker and his wife so they could celebrate the new year properly. The statues in this photo were individually carved sometime between the 1780s to the 1820s, and no two are alike. They line the path at the base of Mount Misen that leads to the Daisho-in Temple, one of the many temples and shrines on the island."

The redwoods in the monument are 600-800 years old, on average, with the oldest being at least 1,200. The tallest tree is about 258 feet, though redwoods grow as high as 379 feet farther north. Redwoods are an important part of the forest ecosystem. They absorb and \"strip\" moisture from fog, which then drips into the ground, supporting the trees as well as other forest life."

Over the following week, he watched as the tiny stars (now joined by a fourth) changed their position relative to the planet while remaining beside it.

The birds use their beaks and talons to hollow out nesting spaces in soft limestone cliffs found in the foothills of the Andes Mountains. The parrots sometimes end up captured and sold as pets for the wild bird trade. While that\"s not illegal—burrowing parrots aren\"t endangered—the capture and sale of these birds and others is part of the focus of National Bird Day in the United States, which is observed on January 5. National Bird Day was created to educate the public about the value of wild birds remaining wild. While keeping a parrot as a pet may seem like fun, the organizers of National Bird Day claim the parrot is going to be healthier and happier in its natural habitat."

It\"s an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level and flooding is a major problem.

In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site."

Thomas Edison created the first practical incandescent lights and used them to decorate his Menlo Park laboratory for Christmas in 1880. Then three years later, the vice president of Edison\"s company, Edward H. Johnson, had Christmas tree bulbs especially made, which he used to decorate the tree in his New York City home. Nevertheless, electric lights didn’t catch on as a holiday decoration among the general public until 1895, when President Grover Cleveland asked that the White House Christmas tree be illuminated by hundreds of multicolored electric bulbs."

        "description": "Hold the tinsel—the rainbow eucalyptus tree doesn\"t need decorations to appear festive for the holidays. Its bark displays a palette of bright colors by design. As older layers of bark peel away in strips, new layers packed with green chlorophyll are revealed. These exposed areas eventually transition to hues of blue, purple, and orange as tannins accumulate. The continual peeling allows the tree to shed mosses, lichen, fungi, or parasites along with the bark, while also exposing the chlorophyll underneath, which boosts the tree\"s ability to photosynthesize. The bark isn\"t the only unusual thing about this species. While most people associate eucalyptus with koalas and Australia, the rainbow eucalyptus is native to the Philippines and Indonesia. It thrives in tropical climates like Hawaii, where our homepage trees were photographed."

At the time, the British were occupying the patriot capital of Philadelphia, just a day\"s march away. Already two and a half years into the war, troops knew the harsh winter would stop the fighting, allowing them to organize and avoid mobilizing for several months. Life, however, was still challenging as they lacked funds for fresh food and clothing. There were no battles at Valley Forge, but nearly 2,000 people died from disease during the encampment."

Saturnalia festivities kicked off with a sacrifice at the temple, followed by a public banquet and a week of general merrymaking. Activities included gambling, eating, drinking, and playing music. Businesses and schools closed, and even slaves were free from work and allowed to participate in the festivities. Many Saturnalia customs evolved into Christmas traditions, such as gift giving, decorating homes with wreaths, and drinking spiced wine."

On the morning of Dec 16, 1944, the beleaguered German army threw its best remaining troops and armor against a lightly defended section of the Allied line. Bad weather neutralized Allied air superiority and over the first few days, the Nazi offensive produced a \"bulge\" in the Allies\" defensive line west into Belgium. Desperate to hold the line, US General Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to defend the strategically important crossroads in Bastogne. The town was surrounded for nearly 10 days by German forces, but the Airborne held out. In fact, a German demand for Allied surrender was rejected with a single word: \"NUTS\" (a bit of 1940s American slang that needed to be explained to the Nazi officers). In the end, the German offensive was defeated, with US forces having borne the brunt of the fighting—Americans sustained their highest casualties of any single battle in World War II."

The construction displaced thousands of black residents from their homes, threatening the livelihood of the community. In the late 1960s, city officials and private donors pieced together funding to install a playground under the new overpass. The park was well used for a time, but due to lack of lighting and maintenance, it eventually fell into disuse."

        "description": "In honor of Alaska National Parks Day, we\"re traveling to Kenai Fjords National Park—home of the awe-inspiring Exit Glacier, seen here. The park sits at the edge of the North Pacific Ocean where frequent winter storms dump the snow that feeds this land of ice. The Harding Icefield crowns the park with at least 38 flowing glaciers—one of which is Exit Glacier. Exit Glacier is known for being one of the most visited of Alaska\"s glaciers, likely because it’s accessible via the Seward Highway. In mid-November, the road to the glacier closes to cars due to heavy snowfall, so visitors can only get there using snow-friendly transportation like dogsled or cross-country skis."

The modular building stands on hydraulic legs and is movable via retractable skis. The five previous facilities, Halley I–V, were each compromised by Antarctica\"s harsh climate and decommissioned. Since 2017, when scientists discovered dangerous cracks in the surrounding Brunt Ice Shelf, Halley has been unmanned during the dark Antarctic winter months—but the research team equipped it with an autonomous micro-turbine that keeps its atmospheric instruments ticking as the snowdrifts pile up."

Of course, the concept of patronizing local merchants is nothing new. Here in Marrakesh, Morocco, souks (markets) like this one in Jemaa el-Fnaa Square have long been a big part of daily life, as well as major tourist attractions. During the day, musicians, dancers, and even snake charmers entertain shoppers as they search for crafts, clothing, and other goods. At night, the focus shifts to dining, with dozens of stalls offering different specialties and takes on traditional Moroccan food."

Scientifically speaking, they’re the same species. The wild turkeys—like these two in Winter, Wisconsin—demonstrate how incredible these birds are in their natural environment. Adult turkeys have some 5,000 to 6,000 feathers, which work kind of like cat whiskers, helping the birds sense their environment. It’s the tom turkeys who have these large tail feather displays—they use them to attract hens. Wild turkeys don\"t fly far and don\"t migrate, but they are agile and can cover short distances quickly. They’re also highly adaptable to new environments, ranging throughout Mexico (where they originated) and the contiguous United States, and into several Canadian provinces as well."

But each fall, millions of these orange and black beauties embark upon one of the world\"s most amazing migrations. The insects make use of air currents to make the long journey south to the mountains of southwestern Mexico, a flight of up to 3,000 miles. Aside from being a staggeringly great distance for these delicate insects to fly, it\"s also a journey to a place that not one of them has ever been to before. And unlike the many bird species that undertake annual round-trip migrations, these butterflies will never return to the north. Why not? Because the distance and length of the total annual migration cycle is greater than the lifespan of individual monarchs."

While at times considered one of the fastest ships in the world, the Cutty Sark’s practical use as a cargo ship was ending almost as soon as it was launched. That\"s because steamships using the much shorter route through the newly opened Suez Canal were able to deliver the highly anticipated tea harvest faster and more cheaply. In 1883, the Cutty Sark began hauling wool from Australia, but within 10 years steamships also disrupted this business."

Beaujolais nouveau is a light-bodied red wine, with relatively high amounts of acidity. Located south of Burgundy, the Beaujolais region has a relatively warm climate, so Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and other famous French grapes don\"t grow well there. But the fruity Gamay grows vigorously in Beaujolais and is used to make Beaujolais nouveau."

This historic church near Le Puy-en-Velay, France, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts visitors from around the world. It was constructed in 969 by a local bishop and dedicated to the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of mountaintops. Even before the chapel was built, the site had spiritual significance, as it was home to prehistoric dolmens (stone tombs) built by the Romans to honor their god Mercury."

        "description": "It\"s harvest time for saffron, the precious seasoning that\"s mostly grown in Iran, but used in cuisines around the world. Saffron is derived from the saffron crocus, an autumn-flowering plant with purple petals as richly hued as the vivid crimson stigmas (called \"threads\") in the center of the bloom. These threads are carefully extracted by hand with tweezers and dried before they\"re used for cooking. Each flower comes with just three threads, and it takes a lot of them—roughly 75,000 crocuses will yield just one pound of saffron. The entire harvest can last only about a week or two, because that\"s the short life of the saffron crocus bloom."

Thousands of people travel across mountains and through the Thar Desert to buy and sell livestock and enjoy the carnival-like atmosphere here. The fair offers visitors many diversions, but it\"s the camels who get top billing. Considered \"ships of the desert,\" camels were domesticated by nomads thousands of years ago to carry goods across forbidding landscapes. When well fed and hydrated, a camel can travel great distances without needing water or food, sometimes for weeks. The humps on a camel\"s back serve a purpose: they\"re fatty deposits that act as a source of nutrition. Here, on the edge of the Thar Desert, the camel remains a mode of transport for nomads as well as a source for textiles, goods, and sustenance (did you know a camel\"s milk does not curdle in the desert heat?). The camel is held in such high esteem, the Pushkar Fair even stages camel decoration contests."

Since 2012, National Bison Day has been observed on the first Saturday of November to acknowledge the animal\"s cultural, historical, and economic significance—as well as its remarkable comeback. Bison were once plentiful in America. Tens of millions strong in the 1800s, they roamed in great herds, helping to diversify and maintain the prairie habitat. They also played an important spiritual role in Native American cultures. Settlement of the American West caused habitat loss and that, combined with overhunting, nearly wiped out the species altogether, until ranchers, conservationists, and politicians teamed up to save them. In 1907, 15 bison from the Bronx Zoo were shipped to a wildlife refuge in Oklahoma to revive the population. Fast forward to today, and around 20,000 bison roam on public lands in the United States. In 2016, President Obama named the bison the National Mammal of the United States."

The sequence, which reads the same backward and forward, is carved onto the stones of the Old Town Bridge Tower at the east end of the bridge and was believed to bring a kind of magical strength to the structure. But the superstition didn\"t stop there. The bridge was also constructed in perfect alignment with the tomb of Saint Vitus and the setting sun on the equinox. A more recent superstition involves the statue of the revered Saint John of Nepomuk that stands on the bridge—according to folklore, rubbing the plaque at the base of the statue will grant you a wish."

Titled \"FOR FOREST: The Unending Attraction of Nature,\" it\"s inspired by a nearly identical pencil drawing created in 1970 by Max Peintner, an artist known in the European environmental movement. Littmann first saw the drawing 30 years ago and in the decades since, he held onto his dream of turning it into a reality. Through his work, he hopes to spark conversation about climate change, perception, and the relationship between nature and people. If you\"d like to see it in person, you\"ll have to hurry.

Today you\"ll find over 100 species and subspecies of the critters here. Most are small, with a pointed nose, large eyes, and a tail. They mainly live in trees and can be highly social, like the ring-tailed lemurs on our homepage, or live a solo existence like the elusive aye-aye. Lemurs have opposable thumbs and five fingers with fingernails on each hand, characteristics that help secure their spot as members of the primate order of mammals. About 65 million years ago, scientists believe, lemurs drifted on rafts of vegetation from the African continent to the shores of Madagascar. Safe from competition and most predators, lemurs evolved into many highly specialized varieties and now can be found in almost all habitats on the island."

They do, however, work well for jelly, apple butter, or even pie filling. The term \"crab apple\" doesn’t refer to a specific species but is used for several types of small apples. In Celtic culture, crab apples are associated with love and marriage. Supposedly if you throw the seeds into a fire while saying the name of your love, the seeds explode if your love is true.

The thick outer layer of a sloth\"s coat is an ideal growing medium for green algae, which forms a natural camouflage in the canopy of tropical forests here in northern South America. If you do spot a pale-throated sloth it will likely be enjoying a simple meal of leaves, limbs, and tree buds. Because sloths don\"t have incisors, they spend most of their waking hours smacking their lips together \"to chew\" their food. This would drive most animals to starvation (if not culinary madness), but the sloth\"s metabolism is so slow that it\"s evolved to survive on less food."

        "description": "We\"re looking at a fall sunrise in Alberta, Canada, in honor (or should we say \"honour\") of Canadian Thanksgiving. The holiday is officially celebrated on the second Monday in October, though many families gather the previous day. The first known Thanksgiving celebration in Canada was organized by English explorer Martin Frobisher in 1578 when he reached Newfoundland. Years later, American loyalists who were faithful to England during the Revolutionary War moved to Canada and brought traditions with them, such as eating turkey on Thanksgiving. As in the US, a Canadian Thanksgiving table is likely to have a horn-shaped cornucopia filled with festive-looking fruits and grains. The menu often includes turkey, but also regional dishes like salmon and Nanaimo bars—a layered chocolate dessert."

The forest canopy is aflame with autumn color, and here, the highbush blueberries on the forest floor provide an additional splash of color. Acadia has six marked coastal trails, and our photo today was taken on one of the most popular: Wonderland Trail. It’s just 1.4 miles round-trip, an easy trek for families and casual hikers. Acadia is Maine’s only national park, and it’s easy to see why this landscape was preserved—look at that beautiful fall color, and that’s just at ground level."

What makes this race so unusual—and so popular—is that it\"s open to both professional and amateur sailors. Its beginning was fairly inauspicious—in 1969 only 51 boats sailed in the inaugural race. But it\"s been drawing increasing numbers of sailors and spectators to Trieste each year. Last year, for the 50th anniversary of the Barcolana, 2,689 yachts raced the course and set the official record for largest sailing race in the world. Featuring a youth sailing race, an open-water swimming race, a night sailing race, music concerts, food and wine tastings, and many other events, the Barcolana offers opportunities for landlubbers and sea dogs alike to enjoy themselves during the regatta."

The colorful landscape here at Arches National Park is home to the highest density of natural arches in the world—upwards of 2,000—as well as hundreds of pinnacles and dramatically balanced rocks. Combine that with the fiery sunsets, pinyon trees, and splashes of sage and yucca, and we\"d say these artists are in for a treat. Lucky for them, October is one of the most pleasant times of year to visit."

The highly intelligent species has been observed solving puzzles, unscrewing lids, and even using tools. One study recorded octopuses collecting discarded coconut shells and carrying them back to their dens to use as shelter. In another incident that made headlines, an octopus named Otto taunted staff at his aquarium by repeatedly crawling out of his tank to shoot water at the overhead lights, causing them to short-circuit. Octopuses aren\"t all brains—they\"ve got heart as well (three, in fact!). The more we learn about this species, the more impressed we are. Can\"t every day be World Octopus Day?"

He would eventually map the entire New Zealand coastline, including the area here at Marlborough Sounds, a network of ancient sunken river valleys on New Zealand\"s South Island. The main purpose of Cook\"s voyage to the Pacific was to sail to Tahiti and observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun. Only after completing this task did Cook unseal the rest of his orders and learn he was to search the South Pacific for signs of a fabled great southern continent, Terra Australis Incognito. European Renaissance geographers believed this hypothetical southern landmass must exist in order to counterbalance the Northern and Southern Hemispheres."

You can try deep-fried shepherd\"s pie, fried beer, or something called deep-fried skillet potato melt. Awards are given to the tastiest concoctions. But the fair\"s flavor extends beyond food. The purpose is to promote Texas agriculture, education, and community. There\"s plenty to do after exploring and sampling one-of-a-kind bites, including live music, pig races—and don\"t forget to ride the Texas Star.

Every 53 days in the course of its wide and complex orbit, the Juno probe makes its closest approach, snapping shots like these as it speeds past the gas giant in just two hours.

Love can be a cruel game, and these penguins are known to steal stones from other nests. But when it comes to parenting, Adélie mates make a progressive couple.

Just as the kelp helps otters, sea otters help the kelp, too. They ensure the kelp\"s survival by eating sea urchins. If sea urchin populations are left unchecked, these spiny vacuum cleaners of the sea destroy kelp forests by munching on holdfasts that tether kelp to the ocean floor. The resulting clear-cut areas, called urchin barrens, are devastating to the overall ecosystem. Kelp forests provide food and safe harbor for hundreds of fish species and other sea creatures.

        "description": "All is not as it appears to be here at Pando, in Utah\"s Fishlake National Forest. At first glance, visitors likely see a massive grove of quaking aspen trees, their leaves dancing in the wind. But Pando is not many trees; instead, it\"s a single organism. Like many aspen groves, the 40,000 trees in Pando are genetically identical cloned stems that sprouted from the same root system. First discovered in 1968, Pando made waves in the scientific world. It\"s become recognized as one of the heaviest known organisms—weighing 6,000 metric tons—and one of the oldest known living organisms. Scientists estimate its root system is upwards of 80,000 years old, having endured the last ice age and countless forest fires. It got to be so old partly because most of the organism is protected underground. So, while an individual stem can die, the organism as a whole survives."

Some of the biggest celebrations this month occur in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, which is recognized as the Mushroom Capital of the World. The town of just 6,000 people cultivates more than 1 million pounds of mushrooms each year, amounting to about half of the total US crop. In recent years, the portobello has become one of the most popular mushroom varieties. Which type of mushroom is your favorite?"

Walruses launch from the ice to eat, making the floating blocks an important part of their survival. With the effects of climate change increasing, Arctic ice is melting, posing an existential threat to the ancient pinnipeds."

It’s a harvest celebration that’s been observed by Chinese and other Asian peoples for thousands of years. The date of the celebration changes each year on our Gregorian calendar, falling on the first full moon of the harvest season, which arrives today. One major feature of the lunar holiday? A sweet pastry called \"mooncake.\" Let it be known that we fully embrace any holiday that includes cake."

Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above. But for those who follow the sun, daytime is perfect for hiking and camping, wildlife viewing, and discovering rock art left behind by prehistoric peoples."

Together they cover 8,036 square miles, with the East park consisting of flat, dry plains, and the West including mountains, volcanoes, lakes, and springs. The gerenuk (which means giraffe-necked antelope in Somali) is a long-necked antelope also known as the giraffe gazelle. It uses its lengthy neck and ability to stand on its hind legs to nibble on shrubs and trees that other types of antelope can\"t reach. It\"s less social then other gazelles, so seeing one alone, as we are in this photo, is common."

California is one of only six states admitted to the Union without first being recognized as a US territory.

The island of Bali has a rich tradition of agriculture, with an especially unique method of water management for rice farming. The irrigation system here, known as Subak, is recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance. Water flows through temples and into the rice paddies, carved into the hillsides like steps. It\"s a practice that dates back thousands of years, based on the Balinese philosophical principle of Tri Hita Karana, which refers to a relationship between humans, the Earth, and the gods."

Smaller fairs like this one in Hardee County, Florida, lead up to larger state fairs in most areas. August is the most popular month for state fairs, though a handful are in July, and some southern states have them during cooler months. Fairs weren\"t always about rides and outrageously fattening foods, though. Beginning with the first state fair in Syracuse, New York, back in 1841, and long before anyone figured out how to fry a stick of butter, there were celebrations of agriculture and livestock, and those traditions continue. So, when you hit your local fair, don\"t forget to check out the giant vegetables and costumed llamas before you get in line for the tilt-a-whirl or a deep-fried Snickers wrapped in bacon."

Springsteen, who grew up near this stretch of the Jersey Shore, clearly finds Asbury Park special—the name of his 1973 album inspired our title for today’s homepage image. But the seaside resort’s rich musical history predates the Boss—a building boom in the 1920s brought sounds of jazz, gospel, and rhythm and blues to the many clubs here. Musicians Arthur Pryor, Count Basie, and many others developed strong ties to Asbury Park and helped establish its reputation as a showcase for great American music."

        "description": "Over two days in late August 1883, Krakatoa—an uninhabited island near Indonesia—experienced one of the most destructive volcanic eruptions of modern times. Ten times more powerful than the eruption of Mount St. Helens, it obliterated all but a third of the island and triggered massive tsunamis. The biggest blast could be heard 3,000 miles away—it’s still the loudest sound ever recorded. More than 36,000 people lost their lives, and the explosions impacted the entire world for years: Global temperatures dropped and skies darkened, causing huge crop failures. Sunsets turned a vivid red and the moon often appeared blue or green after the event due to the volcanic debris circling in the atmosphere."

The Proms (short for promenade concerts) is an annual music festival held in London over eight weeks from July into September. The first Proms took place on August 10, 1895 in the Queen’s Hall in Langham Place, London. After the Queen\"s Hall was destroyed by a bomb during the Blitz, the Proms moved here to the Royal Albert Hall in 1941. This year marks the 125th festival and includes 150 concerts and educational events. While the focus is on classical music, the Proms in the Park event closes out the season with performances from Barry Manilow, Chrissie Hynde, and other pop artists."

The 4.1-million-acre park is home to about 2,200 brown bears, the largest population of protected brown bears on the continent. In summer and early fall, these normally solitary creatures congregate and wade into rivers and streams to feast on salmon returning home to spawn. One of the best spots for bear watching is Brooks Camp, which offers three platforms built just for this purpose. But it takes some effort to get there—the park is only accessible by plane or boat."

This time of year, the soft white wheat harvest is on, as the crop turns from green to gold, and for the farmers, from harvest to profit. Before Europeans and early US settlers arrived, the Palouse was occupied by the Nez Perce people, who bred and raised horses with spotted coats—a breed that would eventually come to be known as \"appaloosas\"—a gradual permutation of the name \"Palouse.\""

Each year, as many as 1.5 million blue wildebeest move through this region following seasonal rains. The annual migration is one of the world’s great wildlife spectacles, a journey that will take the wildebeest some 800 miles, as they seek out lush, green grass and fresh water. August often finds the herd here in the northern Serengeti Plains, a favorite destination for safari-goers who will also see some 200,000 zebras—as well as smaller numbers of gazelles and elands—that accompany the herd. The great number of animals makes this phenomenon one of the largest land migrations on Earth, often called the ‘world cup of wildlife.’"

At the young age of 26, Álvaro Siza designed these Piscinas das Marés (Pools on the Beach). His creation has become a Portuguese national landmark and is praised for the way the pools blend into the landscape from some perspectives, and show a harmonious blend of nature and artificiality from others. The design respectfully floats the pools between the soft sands of the beach and the rocky outcrops that have been here long before 1966, when the project was completed. The shapes of the pools simultaneously follow and oppose the natural lines of the terrain that surround them, a masterful balance that foregrounds the beauty of each, as well as the entirety of the scene Álvaro Siza has helped to set."

Back in 2009, then-Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack officially recognized this event to help raise awareness about the critical role bees play in the world\"s ecosystem and give a nod to the beekeeping industry. Around the world, there are over 20,000 species of bees, which include solitary bees, bumblebees, and honey bees. Of these, only honey bees make honey, but all these industrious insects benefit humans by pollinating roughly a third of the crops we eat. Honey bees do most of the heavy lifting. In the US alone, each year domesticated honey bees pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops such as almonds, watermelons, blueberries, and more."

Because of the remoteness of the find, it would be over 11 months before the rest of the world found out. And it did so in the most dramatic fashion, when the steamers Portland and Excelsior pulled into the harbors of Seattle and San Francisco respectively carrying over one ton of gold (worth more than $1 billion in today\"s dollars)."

Its story starts in 1953, when a single male specimen of the species was discovered near the Ecuadorian town of Mindo. Over the next 13 years, only a handful of additional Ecuadorian horned anoles were found, all males, and each sporting the same long snout that earned its species the nickname ‘Pinocchio lizard.’ So rare and secretive is this anole, that for the next four decades no more individuals were found, and scientists feared the Pinocchio lizard had gone extinct. It wasn’t spotted again until 2004, when researchers glimpsed a female for the first time. She didn’t have a long snout, leading scientists to believe the male’s sword-like appendage is primarily used in courtship (insert your own joke here)."

Mars is the only other planet in the solar system with visible ice caps, though they differ from Earth’s because the ice caps on Mars consist of both water ice and frozen carbon dioxide. The ice cap looks smooth here, but its surface is pockmarked with swiss-cheese-like depressions caused by the seasonal freezing and melting of the Martian winters and summers. While Mars has been observed by humanity for thousands of years, it was only on August 13, 1672, that Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens observed the ice cap using the most powerful telescope of the day. The giant of science designed the 50x magnification telescope himself, and with his brother, produced the lenses as well."

It was built more than three centuries after the expedition\"s return to the city in 1522. While successful in finding a western route to the Pacific Ocean and returning with valuable spices, the feat came at great cost. Only one ship, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, and 17 other crew members completed the global circumnavigation, returning to Spain three years after setting off.

In August and September, white storks depart their nests for a 25-day trip south to their African wintering grounds, where they gather in large flocks. The species returns to Europe again nine months later—hence its unique role in folklore, giving parents a low-stress way to answer the question ‘where do babies come from?’"

The journey to build the obelisk was long and arduous, including a 23-year gap in the construction. According to Mark Twain, the incomplete monument looked like ‘a factory chimney with the top broken off.’ On this day in 1876 the Washington Monument was accepted into the National Park System, and today it’s one of the most recognizable buildings in the US."

Scientists first tracked the migration of giant tortoises in the Galápagos Islands in 2013, and they’ve discovered that not only is it marvelously slow, it’s kind of erratic, and flies in the face of human understanding as to why and how most animals migrate. Only the older tortoises make the roughly 6-mile climb out of the soggy jungle up into the hills—in this case, the slopes of Alcedo Volcano on Isabela Island. The journey is loosely related to mating, but researchers think there may be many other unknown variables at play. Whatever compelled these two lumbering giants up here, in about six months, they’ll start the slow climb back down to the jungle."

Reinders and about 35 family members built the attraction in June 1987. And with another nod to Stonehenge, they dedicated it on the summer solstice that same month. Since then, more than 60,000 people have visited the attraction and it’s appeared in music videos, TV shows, commercials, and even on an album cover."

But the native Ute people also have divine associations with the area, which their creation myth names as the place where all life began. Today, it’s a popular public park and National Natural Landmark. Because it’s within the city limits, locals and visitors alike can get a heaping dose of nature without having to travel far from civilization. If you stroll by any of the rock formations here, you’re likely to see a climber or two scaling the red and pink sandstone walls—or ‘fins’—that give the park its distinct look."

After mating at sea, these big mamas—leatherbacks are the largest of all turtles—haul themselves up onto beaches in the same region where they were born. The turtles dig out nests in the sand and lay a clutch of about 80 fertilized eggs the size of billiard balls. They\"ll repeat this ritual a few more times before returning to their migratory lives in the open ocean. About 65 days later, turtle hatchlings will start to poke up through the sand and make a dash toward the safety of the sea. But the odds are against them: Only 1 percent of the hatchlings will live to reach sexual maturity, at around 16 years old."

After King Alfonso XIII visited in 1921, the walkway was given its nickname, El Caminito del Rey (The King’s Little Pathway).

        "description": "What\"s the best place to see a wild jaguar? The Amazon rainforest may be more well known, but the Pantanal is the world\"s largest tropical wetlands—and the place you\"re most likely to spot a jaguar in the wild. The Pantanal\"s estimated 70,000 square miles cover part of the western side of Brazil and extend into Bolivia and Paraguay. Portions of the Pantanal are protected within national parks and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It\"s difficult to travel there during the wet season (November-April)—high temperatures make it nearly unbearable, and rain and flooding often close roads. Hotels in the region even shut down for periods of time each year. May through September is the dry season, when temperatures cool off and conditions are more friendly to both people and many animals. If you plan to visit, pack some binoculars and keep your eyes peeled for a big spotted cat sitting blithely on the riverbank."

        "description": "You may not be familiar with the name Chefchaouen but its blue beauty is immediately recognizable. Nestled against the Rif Mountains, the city is well known for the medieval walls washed in a hue that mimics the sky on a summer day. There are many theories as to why the walls are this color—some suggest it was thought to repel mosquitos; others say it follows religious beliefs that associate blue with heaven. No matter the reason, the blue creates photogenic passageways, one of which we are admiring here. As you wander through the city, you’ll find the market filled with handmade textiles and other colorful local goods. The locals are mostly Berber, Jewish, and Muslim people who are famously friendly and laid back. Chefchaouen is also brimming with aromatic cuisine that draws visitors from their explorations to the many popular bakeries and restaurants."

        "description": "Today we\"re in Kobuk Valley National Park in Alaska to witness one of the world’s great annual migrations. Every spring, a quarter million caribou come together to form the Western Arctic Herd and pass north through the 1.8-million-acre park to their summer calving grounds in the Brooks Range and its foothills. Then in the fall, the caribou make the reverse trip, heading south back through the park to where they spend the winter in the Nulato Hills and the Seward Peninsula. One of the best spots to see the herd on the move is where it crosses the Kobuk River at Onion Portage. This area is a major archaeological site too. For thousands of years, the crossing has drawn native groups that rely on caribou meat, a tradition that continues to this day."

The route is changed every year but always includes a mix of terrains and elevations, mostly in France. Originally conceived as a promotion for a newspaper, the Tour is now a worldwide sporting event that draws billions of viewers each year, making it more popular than the Super Bowl. Here, competitors are biking alongside the summertime sunflowers of southern France that are in full bloom during the race. This scenic image is a foil to the grueling duration of the race, which covers more than 2,000 miles over a 23-day span. Although athletes are organized into teams, the individual who completes the strenuous course in the overall shortest amount of time wins and gets a cash prize often shared with teammates. This year’s race starts in Belgium and will pedal past the iconic sunflowers around stage 16 before coming to a stop in Paris."

Over the next eight centuries, the various Norse, Scottish, and English rulers of the area added battlements, towers, and the cathedral to the grounds."

All across the United States on July 4, we come together as a nation to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, one of the best break-up letters ever written. In it, the Second Continental Congress puts Great Britain on notice that the 13 American colonies are no longer subject to its rules or rulers and instead have formed a new country, the United States of America. Declaration signers, recognizing the importance of the moment and the message, anticipated that generations later, we would remember and celebrate \"from one end of this continent to the other.\""

Also known as the DN7C highway, the road cuts through the Făgăraș Mountains, offering stunning views of waterfalls, glacial lakes, and lush valleys—plus steep drop-offs and hairpin turns to amp up the drama. Back in 2009, Jeremy Clarkson, co-host of the British TV show \"Top Gear,\" called this twisty route the \"best road in the world,\" which helped turn it into a major tourist draw. The Transfăgărășan reaches elevations just shy of 6,700 feet and has more tunnels and viaducts in its 55 miles than any other road in this mountainous country. But proceed with caution. The speed limit is a sensible 25 mph. And watch out for herds of sheep that use it as a path to greener pastures, and don\"t mind blocking traffic as they amble there."

The San Francisco Bay Area held one of the first Pride parades after the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, the event that sparked the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQI+ civil rights. This is just part of the heritage that will be celebrated at San Francisco’s Pride this weekend, where people will be marking the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. A big parade is planned with vibrant displays that will decorate Market Street, continuing all the way to the Golden Gate City’s Civic Center."

        "description": "It’s the season for spotting fireflies in some parts of the US, especially in the humid or damp areas that the winged beetles love. For fireflies themselves, it’s a season of love. They create these soft flashes of light as they search for a suitable mate. The glow is produced by a chemical reaction in a firefly’s abdomen. In addition to attracting a partner, the light is believed to deter potential predators by signaling that the insect’s chemical makeup may produce a foul taste or even be toxic. The fireflies in our homepage image were photographed with a long exposure in the Philippines, where fireflies are a popular tourist attraction. Some firefly species here and in other parts of Southeast Asia are known for their synchronized flashing, creating dramatic light shows in the dark."

The 6,807-acre park gets its name from the 315-foot spire that offers expansive views of Hickory Nut Gorge and Lake Lure with the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. If you\"re wondering how this sizable flag made it up to the summit, we don\"t know the answer to that. But there is an elevator inside the mountain that can zip you to the top in 32 seconds. The other option is to hike up the 499 steps to the viewpoint."

After unveiling the elephant in 2007 and the Carrousel des Mondes Marins (Marine World Carousel) in 2012, they\"re now working on an ambitious third project, L’Arbre aux Hérons (Tree of Herons), scheduled for 2022.

The vast protected area contains mountain, river, and desert ecosystems, including the largest protected area of the Chihuahuan Desert in the United States. But the ‘big’ doesn\"t stop there. Big Bend is home to 1,200 species of plants, over 450 species of birds, 75 species of mammals, and 56 species of reptiles. (We\"re not sure how many of those are snakes, if you\"re wondering.) Because of its remote location, Big Bend also has among the darkest skies ever measured in the contiguous US. So tonight, the only light you\"ll likely see is the glow from 75 birthday candles—and a few million stars."

The collective’s use of plastic is meant to call attention to the sometimes blurry connection between natural and artificial reality, inviting viewers to reexamine the world around them.

Observed throughout the Portuguese diaspora, the main festivities are military ceremonies, exhibitions, concerts, pageants, and parades on June 10, the anniversary of the death of Portuguese poet Luís de Camões. Camões was an incredibly colorful character whose poem ‘Os Lusíadas’ chronicled the discovery of the sea route to India by Portuguese explorers and the development of the Portuguese Empire. It is regarded as the national epic poem, much like Virgil’s ‘Aeneid’ was to the ancient Romans, and his influence is so great that Portuguese is often referred to as “the language of Camões.”"

        "description": "Humans have been trying to construct artificial coral reefs since at least the 1950s, with only marginal success. But in 1979, German scientist and inventor Wolf Hilbertz created ‘Biorock,’ also known as ‘Seacrete.’ Hilbertz found that by directing a low-voltage charge to a metal frame submerged in seawater, calcium and other minerals in the water would build up on the frame. This mineral coating is so similar to the mineral composition of natural reef substrate that it creates a good habitat for the growth of corals. After the minerals have begun to coat the surface, divers transplant coral fragments from other reefs, attaching them to the structure’s frame. These coral pieces begin to bond to the accreted mineral substrate and start to grow, typically faster than in natural environments. Eventually the reef looks and functions like a natural reef ecosystem rather than an artificial one."

It actually commemorates the women of the Salvation Army who cared for soldiers serving on the front lines of World War I in Montiers-sur-Saulx, France. After several weeks of inclement weather, the demoralized soldiers’ spirits were lifted by a taste from home. The Doughnut Lassies, as the Salvation Army women became known, are often credited with popularizing the doughnut after soldiers returned home after the war. Later, during the depths of the Great Depression in 1938, Chicago’s Salvation Army began National Doughnut Day as a fundraiser to help those in need. The Salvation Army celebrates National Doughnut Day these days by delivering thousands of doughnuts around the country."

The rail-to-trail movement began in the 1960s when many railroad tracks began to be removed and people noted that the relatively flat rail corridors were perfect for hiking and biking trails.

Encompassing some 330,000 acres, it’s of one of the largest remaining tracts of bunchgrass prairie in North America. Once part of an extensive grassland in the region, this portion has remained preserved due to its high elevation, which made farming difficult."

In 1981, Maya Lin was just 21 and still an undergraduate at Yale when she won a nationwide public competition to design the memorial. But when her design was unveiled, its minimalist and nontraditional approach sparked controversy. Many considered it bleak and thought the black granite symbolized defeat rather than honor. To address these criticisms, and over Lin\"s objections, a bronze statue of three servicemen was added to the plan. Later another statue, the Vietnam Women\"s Memorial, was erected south of the wall. Today the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is among the most popular and revered landmarks in DC, drawing over 4.5 million visitors a year."

The decline was attributed largely to golden eagles, who moved into new territory after bald eagle populations declined and found the island foxes to be easy prey. (Golden eagles are more prodigious hunters than bald eagles.) Environmental groups launched an effort to bring back the island fox, in part by relocating golden eagles, and by 2015, the population on Santa Cruz Island had rebounded to about 1,750. That’s good news for the fox–and for the entire island ecosystem. As the eagle situation demonstrated, most things in nature are interconnected."

        "description": "If you’re lucky enough to be one of the thousand or so tourists allowed into Upper Mustang each year, spring and autumn are the best times for trekking through this incredibly dramatic landscape. Tucked into a remote region of Nepal, it’s geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau. The area is surrounded by the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri Massifs and marked with deep gorges, terraced fields, and colorfully stratified rock formations. But perhaps most fascinating of all are the sky caves, 10,000 or so caves dug into the sheer walls of valleys in several areas of the district. Some of these man-made caves are thought to be ancient burial chambers; others are richly decorated with valuable Buddhist paintings, sculptures, and artifacts from the 8th to the 14th centuries. Perched over 150 feet above the valley floor, no one is entirely sure how the caves were built, what they were used for, or even how people accessed them."

The carving we\"re looking at is in Bali, Indonesia. It depicts W.O.J. Nieuwenkamp, a Dutch landscape and portrait artist who rode his bike around Bali in the  early 1900s, painting as he went—essentially biking to work every day. Nieuwenkamp was the first European artist to visit Bali and was influential in introducing Balinese art to Europe. The carving is part of the Pura Meduwe Karang, one of the largest temples in Bali. The temple served as an entrance to the island in the early 20th century and contains several symbols of international influence to reflect that."

        "description": "These massive temples—known today as Abu Simbel—were built in the 13th century BCE by the pharaoh Ramesses II. He left a legacy of monuments and temples across Egypt, many of which, like Abu Simbel, featured Ramesses II himself as the star attraction. But over the centuries, these temples were almost completely buried in sand and forgotten. It was not until the early 1800s when an explorer saw the heads of the colossal statues poking through the sand that the temples were again discovered. Then in the 20th century, construction of a dam on the Nile River formed Lake Nasser, a massive reservoir that would have flooded the site where the temples stood. To save them from inundation, the temples were disassembled and relocated to a nearby hill. The process took almost five years and required that workers cut the temples into pieces and reassemble them exactly as they were built 3,000 years ago. We think Ramesses II would approve."

Lying within both Olympic National Park and the Olympic National Forest, this temperate rainforest gets anywhere from 12 to 14 feet of rain per year. All that water means the Quinault bursts with greenery, especially in spring as mountain snow melts and the river begins to flow with gusto."

        "description": "To celebrate Sant Jordi’s Day today, we’re studying the intricate façade of Casa Batlló in Barcelona, Spain. The holiday is the Catalan celebration of Saint George’s Day, which is observed throughout Europe. According to legend, Jordi (Catalan for ‘George’) saved a princess from the clutches of a terrible dragon. After rescuing her, the knight gave the damsel a red rose, which has become an important symbol of the holiday in Catalonia. As it happens, Spaniards also celebrate April 23 as Book Day, marking the anniversary of the death of Miguel de Cervantes, the famous 16th- and 17th-century Spanish writer. So here in Barcelona, both roses and books are given to loved ones on Sant Jordi’s Day, while music and dancing fill the streets. We might pause in our revelry to spend some time taking in Casa Batlló, designed by Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí. The building is heavily inspired by Sant Jordi’s legend, with red roses on the balconies, and a roof made to look like dragon scales."

        "description": "Earth Day brings us to Midway Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, where this fuzzy Laysan albatross chick is taking in its surroundings. The chick’s home, unfortunately, has a plastic problem. Midway Atoll is part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, not far from the giant gyre of marine debris known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It’s been estimated that some 100 pounds of plastic wash up on Midway Atoll each week, and most of the albatross population has ingested it (they confuse the brightly colored pieces with marine life). For chicks, eating the plastic often proves fatal. But one resilient Laysan albatross named Wisdom has become a symbol of hope. At 68 years old, Wisdom is the oldest known wild bird in the world–and as of 2018 she was still laying eggs. Sounds like a perfect Earth Day mascot."

Their version of the bunny judged whether children had been good or bad during the Eastertide season—with well-behaved kids getting a treat. But rabbits and hares have long been associated with springtime, rebirth, and fertility, so perhaps the leap from gentle backyard visitor to keeper of spring’s ‘naughty or nice’ list was inevitable for these fuzzy critters."

The 555-square-mile park, located mainly within the county of Derbyshire, has a mix of private and public lands. Within the park boundaries, you\"ll find towns, villages, historical sites, and herds of cattle and sheep grazing in the lush hills. About 1,800 miles of hiking trails in the park traverse rolling hills, pastures, and moors. Bonus for the thirsty hiker: The trails also pass by some of the best pubs in England."

For most of the winter, rime ice covers the observatory, as sub-zero water droplets instantly freeze on contact with the building façade. Not only is it cold up here; the winds can be ferocious. It was on this day in 1934 that instruments at the observatory clocked a wind speed of 231 mph. That was the fastest recorded wind speed in the world, until the record was broken in 1996 by Cyclone Olivia on Barrow Island, off the coast of Western Australia."

The biggest and most famous displays will be at Keukenhof outside Amsterdam, which this year is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its public tulip beds. This \"Garden of Europe\" is one of the world\"s largest flower gardens with 800 varieties of tulips and more than 7 million flowering spring bulbs each year.

Although conceived as a utopia for 50,000, only about 2,800 people from over 50 countries live here today. The golden metallic orb, the Matrimandir, is considered the soul of the city, standing in the center of the 2,000-acre township in an area called \"Peace.\" Silence is maintained inside the sphere. A spiraling ramp leads up to a white-marble, air-conditioned inner chamber designed for one to find one\"s consciousness. Reservations required—at least for tourists."

Rufous-tailed hummingbirds are found in forests, gardens, and coffee plantations from southern Mexico down into South America, and they play an important role in pollination. Not to be confused with the smaller rufous hummingbird, which migrates through North America, the rufous-tailed is medium-sized and, like most hummingbirds, is very territorial when it comes to protecting its favorite feeding spots."

Back then, the city was home to about 4,000 people. Today, more than 600,000 people live in Athens, with nearly 4 million in the metro area. Independence Day celebrations in the city start on March 24 with the annual students\" parade and continue the following day with a grand parade that features marching bands and a procession of military vehicles."

Nearly 11 million gallons of oil flowed into the once-pristine waters when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Bligh Reef. The area is so remote that cleanup efforts were delayed, allowing 1,300 miles of shoreline to be contaminated. The US Fish & Wildlife Service estimates that among other casualties, more than 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, and 22 orcas were lost. The spill, while devastating, has provided a living laboratory as scientists study how the ecosystem recovers—and doesn’t. Some species and their habitat are still impacted by the spill. There is at least one highlight: Government agencies say the sea otter population here has fully recovered; however, the local subspecies as a whole remains endangered."

The indigenous cultures of sub-Saharan Africa, where baobabs grow wild, have long relied on the trees for a variety of uses. The fruit, seeds, and leaves are all edible, and in Tanzania, the wood pulp is a fermentation ingredient in local beers. Forests of all kinds provide many natural resources that humans use, and sometimes overuse. This year’s theme for International Day of Forests is ‘forests and education’; it’s an effort to get us all thinking about the more abstract benefits of healthy forests. A dense forest can clean both the air and water by pulling carbon compounds and other pollutants out of the ecosystem, and forests greatly reduce erosion."

When it’s winter in the Northern Hemisphere, those of us above the equator are tilted away from the sun, giving us shorter days and longer nights. In summer, we’re tilted toward the sun, so we can enjoy longer days and shorter nights. But the equinox is right in between. It\"s the moment during Earth\"s annual revolution around the sun when its axis is neither tilting away nor tilting toward the sun, giving everyone on the planet an equal split of day and night. This phenomenon happens twice a year—in March and again in September. For folks in the Northern Hemisphere, today signals a shift toward the long days of summer. But in the Southern Hemisphere, everything\"s flipped. It\"s the autumnal equinox today—and, yes, winter is coming."

Each day of the festival follows a schedule of marching bands in the mornings and fireworks in the afternoon, which is what’s happening in our photo. There are dancers in traditional costumes as well, but the real spectacle comes tonight, as the parade of large, often bawdy wood and papier-mâché figures called ninots are marched through the streets and then added to a huge bonfire to welcome spring."

Ever since the Whitney Museum of American Art held a quilt-focused art exhibit back in 1971, quilts have often hung in galleries and museums as artworks rather than folk crafts. For centuries, though, quilts had a much more utilitarian use—warmth. (Of course, their decorative designs added to the pleasure they gave.) Quilting has a long tradition in the United States, going back to colonial times. Quilts were created not only for bedding but also to commemorate special occasions, like a wedding or a new baby. Quilting bees brought out the whole community—including many men—to share the work."

The planet, along with Neptune, is considered an ‘ice giant,’ with most of its mass made up of a hot, dense fluid of ‘icy’ materials including water, methane, and ammonia all hovering above its small, rocky core. It’s the methane that makes the planet appear blue—the chemical compound absorbs red light from the sun and reflects the blue light back into space. Not only is it cold out there, but it’s also a little lonely.

Our photo looks across the waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea toward the village, with the sun’s rays reflecting off Cefalù Cathedral, the massive church-cum-fortress that dominates the skyline."

But scientists are studying the sometimes surprising ways in which African elephants converse—including the ultra-low frequency vocal sounds they make that are imperceptible to humans. These subharmonic ‘rumblings’ vibrate through the ground and can be felt by other elephants on the bottoms of their feet. And who knows, maybe these sounds follow a kind of grammatical structure we don’t yet comprehend. But perhaps we should start by trying to master English grammar."

So, they’re threatened by climate change, pollution, shipping, and other concerns, but they’ve bounced back from the brink since the early 1900s, by which time centuries of whaling crews had hunted fin whales to near extinction."

These large bears of the Arctic region aren’t endangered but are considered a vulnerable species. As Arctic sea ice coverage continues to shrink due to warming ocean temperatures, the polar bear population faces a rapidly shrinking habitat. Polar bears have large hunting ranges, and rely on the Arctic ice to get around. Their role as an alpha predator in the Arctic is a crucial part of the natural balance in their unique ecosystem. If our sea ice disappears, the bears may soon follow."

On Estonia’s Independence Day today, people will be celebrating in Old Town and across Estonia. They have much to celebrate—Estonian independence was hard-fought. Even though the capital’s origins stretch back 900 years, Estonia didn’t declare its independence until 1918. After centuries of successive rule by a variety of foreign powers, this Baltic state’s path to freedom began in the aftermath of World War I. Estonians resisted German occupation, then fought against invading Soviet forces, eventually earning de jure independence. The independent nation eventually fell back under Soviet power in the chaos of World War II, but regained its freedom after the USSR disbanded in the late 1980s and early ‘90s. But enough of this history lesson—let’s get to the parades!"

The cable cars and viewing platform were upgraded most recently in 2012, and a new feature called ‘Step into the Void’ was added. It allows tourists to stand in a glass room jutting out from the mountain and look down through the glass floor with more than 3,000 feet of free air under their feet."

Archeological evidence suggests that when the Romans first built a temple over the bubbling natural hot springs here between 60-70 CE, they may have been adapting a previous center of worship established by ancient Celts. In any case, the Romans built up a complex of bathhouses over the course of 300 years or so, until the Roman withdrawal from Britain in 410. The baths gradually fell into disrepair, but were rebuilt several times, culminating in the elaborate 18th-century bathhouses that still stand today. Designed by the father-and-son team of John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, the luxurious baths made Bath a fashionable spa town by the late 1700s."

Eight different species of pangolins live in Asia and Africa, and all are known for their solitary, nocturnal lives. Those sharp, protective scales are made of keratin, the same stuff as your hair and fingernails. Pangolins also have short legs and long, curved claws that come in handy when digging into an ant mound or a termite nest for food. By curling into a ball, the pangolin protects its belly and the inner parts of its limbs—the only areas of a pangolin’s body not covered by thick scales. But that defense is useless against its biggest threats, which include deforestation and poaching. We’re grateful for the conservation organizations around the world that are working to protect this species and its habitat."

It nevertheless remained a popular destination for Beatles fans and in 2015, it reopened to the public. Today, visitors will see fan tributes and several murals created by visiting artists."

        "description": "Chichibu, Japan, attracts many visitors during the winter by capitalizing on the cold temperatures that bring unusually large icicles to the terraced banks of the Arakawa River. The attraction, called ‘Misotsuchi no Tsurara,’ is only open from mid-January through mid-February, and includes colored lights after dark, to enhance the otherworldly feel of the scene. Since much of Chichibu sits in or near the Chichibu Tama Kai National Park, there’s abundant nature to see after you’ve witnessed the illuminated icicles on the Arakawa’s banks."

Waitangi Day is New Zealand’s national day, established to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6, 1840. The document was signed by representatives of the British Crown and some 500 Māori chiefs to establish British law on the islands. The treaty also created the framework for political relations between New Zealand’s government and the indigenous Māori people. It’s considered New Zealand’s founding document and a cornerstone in the country’s history."

Parks was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her defiant action sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, one of the longest and most successful movements against racial segregation in our nation’s history.  At the time, African Americans made up most of the ridership on Montgomery city buses. The year-long protest finally ended when the US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s laws enforcing segregation on city buses and other modes of transportation were unconstitutional."

Groundhog Day is an American tradition that originated among the Pennsylvania Dutch, but groundhogs aren’t the only animals believed to predict the weather. It’s said you can predict the severity of an upcoming winter by examining the stripes on a woolly bear caterpillar’s back. And in Germany, folks once looked to the badger to forecast the coming of spring. But no furry prognosticator of the weather has gained as much fame as Punxsutawney Phil. Perhaps we have Bill Murray to thank for that? (Be right back, got to cue up Murray’s film ‘Groundhog Day.’) Say, do you ever have déjà vu? Wait, did we just ask you that?"

The lynx is a crepuscular creature, meaning it hunts mainly in the hours just before dawn and just after dusk. With an adult male lynx growing taller than 2 feet at the shoulder, and weighing more than 60 pounds, it’s capable of hunting roe deer and sheep. And while the Eurasian lynx is a ‘least concern’ status species, habitat loss is affecting how widely dispersed they are across Europe, Russia, and Central Asia. But protected locations, like the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in the Czech Republic, where our lynx was photographed, help preserve habitat to keep this vital predator thriving."

Here in the Shetland Islands, off the northern coast of Britain, the cultural influence of the Vikings is still felt. And when the Yule season comes to a close, many Shetlanders dress up like Vikings—it’s a tradition called ‘guising,’ short for ‘disguise.’ In their Viking costumes, they march the streets of Lerwick singing songs and delivering short comedic performances. Ultimately, a torchlight procession ends with the marchers setting a fake Viking galley ship ablaze. The name ‘Up Helly Aa’ is roughly translated as Up Holy All, an invitation for all to rise and join in the holiday revelry."

Tall swamp gum forests and massive tree ferns distinguish the base of the mountain, but climbing to higher elevations leads to the temperate rainforests of pencil pine, leatherwood, and other trees endemic to Tasmania along the shores of Lake Dobson, shown here. While rare species of plants and animals call the park home, perhaps the park’s greatest diversity lies with its fungi—the tremendous variety of mushrooms found here is still not fully cataloged, but fungi are increasingly understood to underpin the general health of the park’s ecosystems as a whole. And if all that natural diversity here isn’t enough to draw you to Tasmania’s Mount Field, some of the hills and mountains in the park have ski runs during snowy winters."

But architect Peter Eisenman, who designed the work, purposely skewed some of the grid, so that spaces between the slabs may shrink or grow as you walk among the gray blocks. And the gaps are intentionally so narrow that they allow only individual passage. As the visitor navigates through the grid, the subtle shifts in these spaces are meant to shatter the illusion of order and security."

It’s a pagan Slavic custom dating back to ancient times and still takes place each winter in many cities and villages in the Balkan Peninsula of southeastern Europe. The elaborate costumes and loud noises are intended to keep evil spirits at bay. Meanwhile, a member of each participating family—usually the youngest—conducts a blessing called a survakane; using a decorated staff, he or she lightly pats other family members on the back, giving a blessing of happiness and prosperity for the coming year. Traditionally, kukeri performers were men, though women now participate as well."

When it first launched in 1978, the goal of the festival was to highlight American-made films and attract filmmakers to Utah. Robert Redford has long been involved in the festival, serving as chairman at the first event and in the years since, helping it become the media extravaganza it is today. In 1984 Redford’s Sundance Institute took over management of the festival, hence the ‘Sundance’ name, which comes from the name of the character he played in ‘Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.’ In its 41-year history, Sundance has become perhaps the premier showcase for American independent and documentary film. We look forward to seeing what innovative new films steal the limelight in 2019."

The annual event—a simple celebration of the beloved desserts–was created by the American Pie Council (APC), a  group dedicated to ‘preserving America\"s pie heritage and promoting America\"s love affair with pies.’ According to a survey conducted by the APC in 2008, more Americans prefer apple pie over any other, and it’s that variety which inspired our homepage today. But while many things may be as American as apple pie, it’s generally believed that the pie itself originated in England. In fact, English poet Geoffrey Chaucer penned a recipe in 1381 for a pie that includes apples, spices, raisins, figs, pears, and saffron. If you have a favorite pie, it sounds like today’s a sweet day to celebrate."

At about 4 feet tall and weighing up to 100 pounds, it’s both the tallest and heaviest penguin species. The emperor is found only in Antarctica, where it endures wind chills colder than -75 degrees F and blizzard winds of more than 120 mph. It survives these harsh weather conditions by storing lots of fat underneath four layers of feathers. But the emperor penguin truly rules underwater, where it spends roughly half of its life. Studies show that an emperor can dive more than 1,700 feet below the surface, holding its breath more than 15 minutes at a time. It goes to such great depths in search of food, often for its babies back on shore."

So why do the people living in this farmland moor wassail on January 17? Because in Somerset, the locals observe the pre-Gregorian calendar Twelfth Night, which falls on January 17. They may even stage an ‘apple wassail’ with a trip to a local cider orchard, to sing and make noise for a good harvest in the new year."

The islands that make up the Seychelles lay far out in the western waters of the Indian Ocean—the closest mainland is the east coast of Africa, more than 900 miles to the west, and the island nation of Madagascar lies nearly as far to the south. But why go anywhere else when you can wander the beach and romp in the surf in the Seychelles—and perhaps even see an Aldabra giant tortoise in its natural habitat. You know what? We’re going to start packing right now…"

        "description": "Historians believe that falconry may have begun in Mesopotamia as long as 4,000 years ago, but this particular style of hunting with eagles on horseback dates back roughly 1,000 years. Various nomadic tribes from the Middle East and Western Asia trained golden eagles, falcons, and hawks to ride out to the mountains with them, and when the bird spotted a hare or fox, it flew out, caught the animal, and brought it back to the rider on the horse.  Many people in Mongolia continue to hunt in this traditional fashion today. Our photo of an eagle hunter was taken in the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia, where many ethnic Kazakh eagle hunters fled during the communist era of Kazakhstan."

The sport wasn’t invented here in Siberia, but when January sends the mercury plunging, the freezing temperatures create ideal conditions for the sport."

The area is frequently visited by climbers who come to scale the nearby peaks, like this one, called Napoleon’s Hat (it’s thought to resemble the bicorne hat that Napoleon Bonaparte memorably wore sideways). The town is remote enough that tourists must make an effort to get there, but as many travel writers note, it’s well worth it. The villagers here lead a quieter, slower-paced life than those in Morocco’s bustling urban centers such as Marrakesh."

But winter’s snowy landscapes and cold solitude can lend a striking beauty to the scenery and wildlife of many public lands. For example, winter is a great time to enjoy recreational snow activities at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state, pictured here peeking through the clouds at sunrise. An added winter bonus is that visitors can experience public treasures like Mount Rainier without the summertime crowds. Other parks also have distinct charms when the snow falls. Check out dramatic steaming geyser action in the brisk winter air at Yellowstone. Easily spot herds of elk and other wildlife in the snow blanket of the Grand Tetons. Or walk among the snow-capped hoodoos (towering red-rock spires) of Bryce Canyon. You may decide wintertime is the right time to visit your national parks."

If you’re in snowy owl territory, keep a lookout for its signature wintry white plumage. While adult male snowy owls are almost entirely white, young owls and adult females like this one have patterns of black feathers among the snow-white plumage. All snowy owls have unmistakably golden eyes, and like other owls, they can rotate their heads about 270 degrees."

The open balconies and winding staircases were meant to encourage people-watching, especially among the upper class. Commissioned by Napoleon III as part of his grand, transformative renovation of Paris, the Palais Garnier first opened on this day in 1875. Immediately upon opening its doors, it became the place to see and be seen—and to be surrounded by opulence. The domed ceiling shown here was painted by Marc Chagall in 1964, covering the original ceiling paintings by artist Jules Lenepveu. Chagall’s colorful, dreamlike work stretches nearly 2,600 square feet and depicts scenes from operas by 14 different composers, including Beethoven and Debussy."

Of course, you don’t have to get to Japan and climb Fuji or any other mountain to watch the new year sun peek over the horizon.

It grazes on algae just as a sheep grazes on grass, and it bears more than a little resemblance to an actual sheep. Sea sheep don’t digest the chloroplasts in the algae they eat—instead, they absorb the energy-producing cells. As a result, the leaf-like fins all over the sea sheep’s back are loaded with working chloroplasts, making the sea sheep one of the only non-plant life forms on Earth with the ability to photosynthesize—that is, produce its own energy using sunlight and water. Who knew an evolutionary advancement could be so cute?"

The chemical pesticide DDT, previously thought to be safe, was causing high mortality rates for bald eagle chicks, as well as many other birds exposed to the chemical. DDT was banned, and the eagles’ numbers began to rise again."

Various American Indian tribes have given it equally descriptive names, including the Long Night Moon, as it occurs near the winter solstice. Other Native American terms include Oak Moon, Big Spirit Moon, and Snow Moon. The Cold Moon of 2018 rises this evening about 15 minutes after sunset.

        "description": "These days, Tchaikovsky’s ballet ‘The Nutcracker’ is an iconic holiday entertainment staple, produced by companies around the world. In this photo, the Moscow Ballet performs the seasonal crowd-pleaser in Toruń, Poland. But when the ballet debuted this day in 1892 in St. Petersburg, Russia, it was not a hit. ‘The Nutcracker’ was revived and restaged in the early 20th century, but still didn’t make an impact. Then in 1944, the San Francisco Ballet performed the American debut of the ballet to great acclaim. It became a true Christmastime classic 10 years later, when choreographer George Balanchine staged his own 1954 production with the New York City Ballet. Balanchine’s version caught on and inspired other dance companies to stage it themselves. Today, ‘The Nutcracker’ is often such a draw that a staging of Tchaikovsky’s Christmas fantasy can help keep a ballet company financially stable."

Orville Wright snapped this photo of the plane as it’s piloted by his brother Wilbur, gliding down the slope of Big Kill Devil Hill in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in October 1902."

This year, the CBC runs from today through January 5, 2019, giving citizen scientists across North America time to join in, get outside, and spot some birds. The data collected is used to gauge the health of various bird populations–this information is then used to focus conservation efforts on particular species and geographical areas."

Tonight, the Gully Gawk is scheduled for a visitation, waiting for an opportunity to sneak into the cowshed and steal milk. Modern versions of the lads sometimes portray them in a benevolent light, even dressed like Santa Claus, but other stories are dark. The lads are said to be the sons of Gryla, a mountain troll with an appetite for mischievous children. Let’s hope we’re on the nice list this year."

He discovered the plant while he was serving as the first US ambassador to Mexico, the plant’s native country, where Aztecs once used it to produce red dye. According to legend, the poinsettia’s association with Christmas began in 16th-century Mexico, where a little girl—too poor to buy a gift—gathered weeds from the roadside and placed them in front of a church altar. They eventually produced lovely red leaves alongside the green ones, and the poinsettia plant was on its way to becoming a Christmas tradition."

Last year, 174 million Americans shopped on Black Friday weekend, according to the National Retail Federation, presumably moving retailers’ balance sheets from red (losses) to black (profits). But the term ‘Black Friday’ has a darker history. It was originally used to describe a financial crisis in 1869, and later adopted by Philadelphia police to describe post-Thanksgiving chaos at department stores in their city. Retailers later co-opted the phrase ‘Black Friday,’ giving it more positive connotations–a shift toward profitability at the start of the crucial holiday shopping season."

It became the Apollo in 1934, when it was opened to black patrons, who by then had transformed Harlem into a thriving center of African American culture. Amateur Night at the theater began the first year the Apollo opened, and it’s been a defining part of the Apollo experience ever since. Amateur Night has also been instrumental in launching the show business careers of numerous stars, including Jimi Hendrix, and on this day in 1934, a teenage Ella Fitzgerald, who won the amateur contest, starting her down a path toward becoming one of the most iconic singing voices of the 20th century. Tonight, the Apollo is hosting its Grand Finale for the 2018 Amateur Night season. Perhaps somebody taking the stage tonight will go on to greater fame?"

These shallow waters are an ideal habitat for Chilean flamingos—they dip their comb-like bills into the water to filter out tasty plankton and algae."

Perhaps the most distinctive of the aquarium’s exhibits is its giant tank of whale sharks. The 6.3-million-gallon tank houses four whale sharks—the world’s largest fish—as well as four manta rays and thousands of other fish. The tank is so massive, the rest of the aquarium was designed around it."

Historians think the images of the big cat are expressions of jaguar worship by the indigenous tribes who have lived in the broader area for millennia. This park protects and preserves a 17,000-square-mile expanse of the Colombian Amazon, with a diverse ecosystem supporting many endemic species. In addition, officials believe that Chiribiquete could be home for various indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation, the descendants of those who painted the ancient rock art. Both the human cultural history of this place and the extraordinarily pristine natural beauty of the landscape are what earned Chiribiquete UNESCO World Heritage status this year—the rare location to meet both cultural and natural criteria for inclusion on the UN’s list."

Monet is considered a father of impressionism, the artistic movement characterized by thin brushstrokes and depicting the visual impression of the moment–especially in terms of light and color.

In fact, researchers identify many of the manatees in Blue Spring by the scars they bear from accidental boat collisions and motor blade cuts. Identifying individual manatees has been crucial to tracking the population rebound of this once endangered species. A 2016 census of manatees in Florida’s springs counted 6,250 of the large, surprisingly graceful beasts."

Part of his inspiration for Neuschwanstein was the composer Richard Wagner, whose operas appealed to Ludwig’s romantic sensibilities.

In fact, what’s truly scary is how much we’d miss bats if they were gone. In North America, a disease called white-nose syndrome has killed millions of bats since it was identified in 2006–and scientists are working hard to find a way to help bats recover. One easy way to help bats is to build or buy a bat box for your property, and provide them with a safe space to roost."

Then, they said, they encountered the ghost of Marie Antoinette, whom they spotted calmly lounging and drawing in her sketchbook. The queen of course had been guillotined a century earlier.

King Richard I commissioned the castle in 1196, when England occupied portions of modern-day France. The English and French fought for control of the castle for roughly 400 years—a span including the Hundred Years War—before Henry IV of France ordered it demolished. Today, the outer walls—called baileys—are open to the public year-round, while the inner baileys are open during summer months."

So, if you’re observing United Nations Day today, we’re celebrating with you. This art installation depicting a flock of doves was suspended over the Piazza del Duomo, just outside Saint Andrew’s Cathedral in Amalfi."

This species, known as the dawn redwood, was thought for hundreds of years to be extinct. Unlike other redwood trees (picture the towering evergreen giants that grow on California’s coast), this redwood is deciduous; in the fall its needles turn a brilliant orange, and then fall to the ground. Fossils of the species are common in the Northern Hemisphere, but there was no known evidence that it existed after the Miocene Epoch, which ended more than 5 million years ago. The tree was thought to have been long extinct until 1944, when a giant dawn redwood was discovered in south central China. More were found in surrounding lowlands, and today the tree is a popular ornamental in many parts of the world. The trees in our image, from Zhongshan, China, are standing in a shallow lake, which reflects the blue sky above."

The meridian itself is essentially an imaginary line, arbitrarily placed. By the early 19th century, most maritime countries had established their own prime meridians to aid in navigation. But on this date in 1884, delegates from 25 nations met at a conference in Washington, DC, where they established Greenwich as the international standard for mapping and timekeeping. The decision made sense, as the Greenwich meridian was already widely used. But there was one holdout: France abstained from the vote and used its own prime meridian for several decades before eventually joining other countries in recognizing the Greenwich meridian."

The walls of the cave now known as ‘Lascaux’ are covered with hundreds of images–giant drawings of bulls, horses, and humans–created some 17,000 years ago, in the Upper Paleolithic Period. The cave was opened to the public in 1948, but after several years, scientists observed that the artwork was being damaged by carbon dioxide, heat, humidity, and other contaminants produced by an average of 1,200 visitors who explored the caves each day. To protect the prehistoric masterpieces, the cave has been closed to the public since 1963. Today, the closest you can get is viewing full-scale replicas at the International Centre for Cave Art in nearby Montignac, where our homepage image was photographed."

When women work, economies grow. And when the share of household income controlled by women increases, children benefit. It’s all the more reason to invest in education and equality for women and girls around the world."

Most of the consumer goods we buy traveled across oceans on massive container ships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that as much as 90 percent of global trade relies on ships. The IMO created World Maritime Day to call attention to the hard work mariners do finding the most efficient and safest shipping routes around the globe."

The Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park is where General Sherman, the largest tree in the world, stands. It is estimated to be 2,300 to 2,700 years old—a silent witness to both natural and human history. By the time Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa ‘found’ the Pacific Ocean in 1513, General Sherman had been growing for more than 1,500 years."

Why call it ‘Oktoberfest’ when it begins in September? The original Oktoberfest began on October 12, 1810, as a massive one-day royal wedding celebration open to the public. On October 12 the following year, Munich citizens commemorated the wedding with another party, and an annual tradition was born. The festivities grew longer and longer each year over the course of two centuries, and Oktoberfest eventually extended into the weeks before the original date. Organizers supported the earlier start to take advantage of better weather in late September, but the party will forever be known as Oktoberfest."

        "description": "To celebrate Frankenstein Day, aka the birthday of writer Mary Shelley, we bring you this moody photo of Frankenstein Castle at Darmstadt, Germany. A man named Johann Dippel lived here once, and is said to have been involved in attempts to reanimate body parts of the deceased. Sound familiar? That may be because Dippel’s life is thought to have influenced the creation of the novel ‘Frankenstein’ by Mary Shelley. While scholars debate the real-life inspirations, we do know that Shelley was just 19 when she crafted the story, essentially written on a dare made by poet Lord Byron. While spending a rainy summer on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, Shelley (nee Godwin), her future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Byron, all decided to try writing ghost stories. Mary Shelley outdid them all by creating the well-known story of the mad doctor who brings the dead back to life. Her book is often cited as the first true work of science fiction."

        "description": "The blue wildebeest embark on their spectacular annual migration to follow seasonal rains and the growth of plentiful grasses. The timing can vary from year to year, depending on the weather. But generally by this point in the year, the giant herds are moving from the northern Serengeti in Tanzania across the border into Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve, shown in this photo. The annual migration sees over 1 million of these grass-eating bovines crossing miles of African savanna, often following the plains zebra as they make similar trek. By December they’ll be back in Tanzania for the rainy season. Many of the nations where the wildebeest migrate recognize that keeping the migration safe and healthy draws in tourist money. Many parks and preserves are established along the migration route, ensuring the safety of the animals, and allowing humans to view this marvel in person."

One school supply that unites most students is the classic, yellow-coated, No. 2 pencil. For centuries, the pencil was a tool so vital that many would use theirs until only a tiny stub remained. An entire market for various pencil accoutrements existed in the 18th and 19th centuries, including a pencil grip called an ‘extender’ that allowed you to use the last bit of a pencil so as not to waste what was, at the time, a precious commodity. Think of it in terms of all the things you buy to enhance your mobile phone or tablet, and then imagine that the pencil once held equal value as a communication device. (In our hearts, it still does.)"

        "description": "Barataria Preserve is one of six distinct locations that make up Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve in Louisiana. The wetlands and bay at Barataria are tied closely to the history of this portion of the Mississippi River Delta. In the late 1700s, Barataria Bay was where the well-dressed smuggler and occasional pirate Jean Lafitte and his brother Pierre built a port. Far from the nearest US naval base and the prying eyes of customs officials, Barataria offered the brothers a safe place to smuggle in goods they\"d stolen from ships in the Caribbean, or sometimes bought on the black market. They then sold the merchandise, mainly to merchants in New Orleans. Jean Lafitte and his comrades also helped to defend New Orleans against the British in the final battle of the War of 1812. These days, he’s chiefly remembered for his heroism in the Battle of New Orleans and for the jobs and goods he provided in the region--the erstwhile pirate is a folk hero of a sort, and famous enough that a national historical park was named for him."

But history has many stories to tell and the Gateway Arch, with its new national park status, includes many more perspectives on our nation’s westward growth.

Today marks the 30-year anniversary of Black Saturday, a day when the park saw some of the worst damage, with smoke and ash blackening the skies. But when cool, moist weather brought an end to the devastating fires in late autumn, the ecosystem immediately began to recover. Fire has long been part of the complex ecosystem at Yellowstone and many species have even adapted to rely on fire to open up the canopy, spread seeds, and diversify the habitat."

The modern beehive boxes shown here contain frames to hold honeycombs that bees produce to store their honey, pollen, and young. When the bees have produced plenty of honey, the beekeeper can simply remove the frames to extract some of it, leaving the rest to nourish the hive."

As the concept of the ‘Russian Mountain’ ride caught on across Europe, mechanical parts came into play, including sled-like vehicles to ride in, and rails to keep the carts on track. Over the centuries, these coaster-like rides grew to resemble the extreme, gravity-challenging thrill rides we see at modern theme parks. Where is your favorite roller coaster?"

The small town of Sturgis, population roughly 7,000, swells to a gathering of half a million for this event, which includes 10 days of races, concerts, and revelry. The Sturgis rally was founded in 1938 by the Jackpine Gypsies Motorcycle Club and Sturgis resident Clarence ‘Pappy’ Hoel–a legend in these parts. What started as a modest gathering of just nine riders is now one of the largest rallies in the world."

The history of how the festival began depends on who you ask and what you read. But the way to celebrate is to join or watch the parade that is the centerpiece of the observance. The floats depict mythic warriors and creatures, and they move through Aomori accompanied by musicians, often playing flutes and pounding on loud taiko drums. The goal? To ‘awaken sleepy souls.’"

Why celebrate an apex predator that most humans associate with horror movies? Because without sharks acting as population control on other marine life, the world’s oceans would be a very different place. Blue sharks eat a lot of squid and fish, and like land predators, help to keep their prey from overpopulation. Mother Nature keeps us in a delicate balance, so it’s important that we don’t accidentally remove a vital member of that system… even if that creature seems scary to most of us."

If you’re new to the competition, here’s what you need to know: The race includes 21 stages that span 22 days. Competitors will climb at grades of up to 11 percent through the Alps and Pyrenees, and pedal over miles of cobblestone and dirt roads, country lanes and highways, at last coming to a finish at the Champs-Élysées in Paris. When you see the peloton, keep an eye out for the yellow jersey–at each stage it’s worn by the cyclist with the overall leading time and is ultimately awarded to the winner. Bonne chance, riders!"

It’s estimated that fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remain in the wild. Organizations like the World Wildlife Fund are working to protect their habitat, and your support can make a difference."

The stars were arranged on a blue background to represent a ‘new constellation.’ In 1795, as Vermont and Kentucky joined the Union, two more stars and two stripes were added. It was this version that served as muse to poet Francis Scott Key, who penned the poem that would later serve as the lyrics for ‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’ He wrote the words after watching the flag fly over the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. The flags in our image are rippling over Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey."

But if you can’t catch a ride in a basket under a giant balloon today, know that the idea dates back at least to 3rd-century China, where paper lanterns were used as military signals. Fast forward to 18th-century France, where two paper-making brothers, the Montgolfiers, launched unmanned hot air balloons. Then, to great fanfare, they tried sending up a sheep, duck, and chicken, and finally, Étienne Montgolfier took a ride. Designs have improved since then, resulting in the standard hot air balloon seen here."

When ‘Leaves of Grass’ was first released in 1855 it was considered controversial for its imagery of sexuality among other wide-ranging topics. Expressed as a form of free verse without rhyme and with ever-changing meter and rhythm, Whitman’s style was highly personal, but also expansive, meant to reflect the limitless possibilities of Americans and the United States itself. He spent years revising and adding to the compilation of poems and today is regarded as one of the most important of American poets. He once said, \"Keep your face always toward the sunshine—and shadows will fall behind you.\""

The president’s pose was designed to represent both his strength and compassion (one fist is clenched, the other at rest), and even the building materials were sourced from locations significant to his life and legacy. Look closely at the inscription on the wall of the north chamber and you’ll even spot a typo in the text of Lincoln’s second inaugural address, where the sculptor carved ‘EUTURE’ instead of ’FUTURE.’ Oops!

Sometime in the spring of 1718, ‘La Nouvelle-Orléans’ was founded by French investors. Since then, residents of the Big Easy have chosen May 7 as the day to celebrate the birth of New Orleans. Really, this city doesn’t need an excuse to throw a party, but this one’s going to be big."

Some of the film props—seen in this photo—are still standing, and continue to draw tourists into the region."

These nazars decorate the branches of a tree in Georeme National Park in the Cappadocia region of Turkey, a landscape known for unusual rock formations and extensive underground cities built during the Byzantine era. The dwellings protected residents from hostile invaders, who may or may not have delivered evil curses."

Pictured here is the Ghost Panel, named for about 20 life-sized figures that seem to hover above viewers."

Keep zooming in and you’ll likely see sawgrass marshes, mangrove trees, tropical birds, and a gator or two. Among the myriad interesting things about this unique and fragile ecosystem—it’s the only place in the world where American alligators and American crocodiles co-exist. How do you tell the difference between the two? Well, you see one later and the other after a while. (See what we did there?)"

This year we’re celebrating by featuring a homepage image of a different national park for each day of the festivities, starting with the granddaddy of US national parks–Yellowstone. This is the Grand Prismatic Spring, a hot spring at Yellowstone that spans 370 feet in diameter and reaches depths of 160 feet, making it the largest hot spring in the US and the third largest in the world. The rainbow of vivid colors is created by heat-loving bacteria that reside in the water. Come back tomorrow to see where we go next."

The Arve’s much lighter color is due to the silt it picks up as it flows out of the Alps. From here, the Rhône will continue on—in a mostly southerly direction—through southeastern France toward its mouth on the Mediterranean Sea."

If your job doesn’t take you to a snow-covered Antarctic island, then why not celebrate by observing National Walk to Work Day today?"

Staring down the ‘Charging Bull’ statue with resolute defiance, ‘Fearless Girl’ immediately resonated with people around the world as a symbol of women taking positions of leadership. The statue was initially meant as a temporary installation, but many have called for her to become a permanent fixture."

The historic Chapel of St. Michel, established in 1020 and rebuilt in the 17th century, survived the flooding of the valley—but it became an island destination in the process."

The cherry trees had been a gift from the city of Tokyo in 1912. Ultimately, the protest didn’t delay the project, some trees were lost but others were planted, and the memorial was complete in 1943."

Here you’ll find miles of unspoiled beaches, maritime forests, and the remnants of early island inhabitants such as missionaries and cotton farmers. Only ruins remain at the site of Dungeness, a mansion built by industrialist Thomas M. Carnegie, brother of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, in the 1880s. But in its prime, the ornate 59-room residence served as a home for Carnegie’s family and their guests. These days, the island’s band of wild horses enjoys grazing at the site."

The largest recorded iceberg, known as B-15, had a surface area larger than the island of Jamaica (just imagine what that baby looked like under water!). On the other end of the spectrum, hunks of ice smaller than 16 feet across are known as ‘bergy bits’ and ‘growlers.’"

Given the heavy load, the kori bustard prefers to travel by foot, and is known to be slow and careful as it forages for food. This bird is so large, in fact, that smaller birds are known to perch on its back and catch a free ride."
