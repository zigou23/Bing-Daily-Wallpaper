Covering more than 150 square kilometres, it's one of the state's oldest national parks. As you follow the winding road up through the park, you'll see a whole range of landscapes, from temperate rainforests full of some of the world's tallest eucalyptus trees to alpine moorland. These ever-changing views are what give the park its nickname, 'the park for all seasons.' One of the park's must-visit sites is Russell Falls, a three-tiered waterfall that plunges 50 metres."

Built during the 9th century in the reign of the Shailendra dynasty—an influential ruling family in Southeast Asia—it's the world's largest Buddhist temple, standing tall on the island of Java, Indonesia. This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. After being abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 19th century by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Stamford Raffles."

Found along the coastlines of over 140 countries, they nest in more than 80 countries year-round. They are rarely found in Canada because they prefer warmer, tropical and subtropical waters, which Canadian waters do not provide. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrates. This coral can grow to around 2 metres and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over."

The 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

This celebration centres around the unadorned aluminium Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus 'airing of grievances' gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they've disappointed you over the year. According to some mental health professionals, this tradition could be good for people's mental well-being, providing some much-needed catharsis at what can be a difficult time of year for many people."

This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate International Mountain Day, an event to honour the towering giants of our planet. Among them are the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, or the 'Three Peaks of Lavaredo,' seen on the right in today's image. A part of the Sexten Dolomites in northeastern Italy, they're one of the most famous mountain groups in the Alps. These three peaks—Cima Grande, Cima Ovest and Cima Piccola—are a UNESCO World Heritage Site that captivates adventurers and nature lovers alike. During World War I, the front line between Italy and Austria-Hungary cut through the peaks, leaving the area with many remnants of the conflict, such as fortifications, trenches, tunnels and commemorative plaques."

Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain.

These creatures, part of the same family as camels, alpacas and llamas, are native to the rugged landscapes of South America. Standing around 110 centimetres tall and weighing up to 90 kilograms, guanacos travel in herds led by a dominant male, accompanied by females and their young. After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized. It is used to create luxury fabrics and is valued second only to vicuña wool across the Americas."

Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

Together, they hold 21% of the world's fresh surface water. Of these, Lake Ontario, standing between the states of Ontaio and New York, has the smallest surface area and was named 'Ontario' by Europeans in 1641. Covering approximately 18,960 square kilometres, it has been an important waterway for centuries. By the 18th century, the lake had become a strategic hub for the fur trade, particularly during the French and Indian War and later the War of 1812. Today, historic forts like Fort Niagara and Fort Henry stand as reminders of these turbulent times near the lake."

These stunning structures form when calcium-rich fresh water from several creeks and streams flows into the lake, mixing with its alkaline waters. Over centuries, this interaction causes calcium carbonate to accumulate, gradually creating tufa spires that rise above the lake’s surface."

The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims and invaders alike."

This scenic road in the north-west of the province connects Kitimat with the Yukon border. It winds its way through some stunningly rugged locations, taking drivers past lakes, through forests and around mountains. But it's in fall that it truly comes to life, with the aspen trees along the route shedding their summer green colouring."

At 9 metres tall, Porthcawl lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit this coast. The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

The name 'Manarola' might have evolved from the Latin 'Magna rota,' which became 'Magna roea' in the local dialect. It means 'large wheel,' a nod to the village's historical mill wheel. Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalised in the verses of Italian poets."

Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 44 metres and is 34 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches."

Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves.

Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

This village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described it as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

        "description": "Once upon a time, in the boundless grasslands of North America, there roamed creatures of great strength and majesty—the American bison. These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image."

By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits."

The salty sea air from the Baltic Sea and the moist climate contribute to the trees' distorted shapes, giving rise to the forest's haunted moniker. Visitors experience light-hearted brushes with the supernatural, such as the crunch of dead leaves, a friendly spirit waving hello from afar or a mischievous ghost peeking from behind a tree. The strategic lighting, which casts ghostly shadows, along with the sculptures and decorations placed along the path, are elements that enhance the forest's ghostly aura throughout the year."

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

Today's image features Coco Beach, a gem tucked away in Nerul, a village in the northern part of the state. Despite its calm vibes, there's plenty to do here. You can soak up the sun and dive into adventures like fishing, boating, dolphin spotting and swimming, all while immersing yourself in the local culture. But there's something that makes this beach even more special: its historical significance. It played an important role in the Goa Liberation Movement during the 1950s and 60s. It was one of the places where locals fought to end Portuguese rule and unite Goa with India. So, Coco isn't just another beach; it's a place with stories to tell, where history meets the sea."

        "description": "Today we're stepping into the heart of the historic empire of Islamic Spain. The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th-century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

The bar-tailed godwit embarks on an 11,000-kilometre nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering 30,000 kilometres. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues."

Because of Cape Breton Island's isolation and the lack of outside influences, the culture and traditions of these settlers remained particularly strong. Held when the island's fall colours are most vibrant, the festival has blossomed into a nine-day extravaganza that coincides with the warm red, orange and yellow autumn foliage."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi."

This range was named after William Ogilvie, who was a Canadian Dominion land surveyor. Part of the Yukon Ranges, these mountains are crossed by the Dempster Highway, a route famed for its pristine views. Some of the picturesque peaks of Ogilvie Mountains are located within Tombstone Territorial Park. Wildlife, from moose to Canada lynx, roams the terrain in fall, searching for the last bounties of the season. Yukon's fall is a fleeting period, characterised by crisp air and autumn hues."

Male walruses can be almost 4 metres long and weigh more than 1,200 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Vatnajökull—the second largest ice cap in Europe—stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater."

        "description": "This week is Sea Otter Awareness Week, an event that draws attention to these fluffy floating mammals. The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized."

The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow fall in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun."

The origin of this holiday goes back to a 1995 joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers. During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, today be for all to enjoy. So, batten down the hatches, set sail and remember: on this day, everyone can be a pirate."

Originally constructed in 1559, this castle has witnessed centuries of Japanese history, including the rise and fall of powerful clans. It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes and hues, symbolising good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales."

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

Designated as a provincial park in 1972, this landscape preserves a unique microenvironment, hosting arctic plant species typically found 1,000 kilometres to the north. In 2022 the park celebrated 50 years of conserving this unique slice of Canadian natural heritage. The two viewing platforms on the west side provide spectacular vistas of the canyon's depth and the verdant forest below. The park's incredible geology owes its existence to the last Ice Age, which left behind this awe-inspiring feature that continues to attract nature enthusiasts and photographers alike."

The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."

These primarily nocturnal raptors were photographed in Pakistan but can also be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 48-53 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 0.6 metres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

As the longest river entirely in England, the Thames has been a silent witness to time's dance, from Roman conquests to Shakespearean dramas on its banks. Over the centuries, kings and queens have weathered its tides, with the iconic Tower of London standing sentinel along its banks. Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 346 kilometres before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. It also flanks several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. With every ebb and flow, the Thames invites us on a journey through time, a fluid chronicle of England's enduring saga."

As the world's largest fish, whale sharks can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metre. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint."

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to six metres and weighing as much as 40 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image.

        "description": "Come one, come all, to the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE)—a time-honoured tradition held from August 16 to September 2 in Toronto. As the sun sets, the grounds of the CNE will come alive with live performances from artists and bands like Doriann Forrester, James Naro and Kyle Layton, Sloan, and MacKenzie Porter. A lineup that spans all musical tastes, from toe-tapping country beats to electric pop rhythms—there's a song for every taste. As well as music, there's plenty more to do; go for a ride on the Century Wheel or the Berry Go Round, or take part in games like the Peewee Baseball Tournament and Girls Fastball Tournament."

During a jungle expedition, he found the entrance to a cave with a roaring underground river, which was later named Hang Sơn Đoòng or 'cave of the mountain river.' In 2009, the British Cave Research Association led an expedition to explore the site. It was then that they realised something incredible: it was the world's largest cave. How large, you ask? Hang Sơn Đoòng's main passage is 5 kilometres long, 150 metres wide and 200 metres high. That's tall enough to fit a 40-storey skyscraper! Inside, there is a 60-metre calcite barrier called the 'Great Wall of Vietnam' and stalagmites stretching as tall as 80 metres."

Today, World Lizard Day, is the perfect time to learn about these cold-blooded creatures. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Take the gecko, for example. These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature."

Telašćica Bay, on the country's Adriatic coast, is encircled by 13 islands and six islets. Featured in today's image are the bay's cliffs. They form a stunning inlet that stretches over 10 kilometres with dramatic cliffs, islets and serene bays. Locally known as the 'stene,' these cliffs reach a height of 161 metres above sea level. Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag."

This habitat loss brings them into closer contact with humans, which can lead to serious problems for both elephants and humans."
