        "description": "In a quiet valley of western Honduras lie the ruins of Copán—a city of the ancient Maya civilisation. Its sky served as both compass and calendar, guiding celestial events and shaping temples, rituals and the rhythm of life. Around 426 CE, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', a warrior from the Maya heartland, founded Copán and established its royal dynasty. The city became a centre of Maya art, astronomy and power."

Its sleek body can reach speeds of up to 70 mph, making it the fastest land mammal on Earth. Long legs and a flexible spine allow incredible acceleration, while its strong tail helps maintain balance during high-speed chases. Today is International Cheetah Day—an event that couldn't have arrived any quicker. With fewer than 7,100 individuals left in the wild, these are among Africa's most vulnerable big cats."

Leipzig's Christmas market began in 1458 and quickly became a favourite stop for merchants and locals alike. Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes. This is where townsfolk gather to celebrate winter and catch up on news while sipping mulled wine. These markets have always symbolised more than shopping—they offer an escape from the everyday routine."

St Andrew wasn't born here—he was a fisherman from Galilee and one of Jesus' twelve apostles. According to legend, his relics were brought to the east coast of Scotland in the 4th century, giving rise to the town of St Andrews and inspiring the country's flag, the white saltire cross on blue."

To merge art and nature. They brought it to life by placing artwork within the landscape, like 'Three Upright Motives' by English sculptor Henry Moore in the Pampelse Zand and the President Steyn stone bench by Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, among others."

In 2019, UNESCO established November 26 as World Olive Tree Day, recognising these trees that have been cultivated by humans since about 6,000 BCE. Olives have carried both practical and symbolic weight through the ages: their oil was pressed for anointing, medicine and daily sustenance; crowns of their leaves graced Olympic victors; and their branches became a lasting emblem of peace."

The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 26-metre marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses."

Carved into a riverside cliff at the confluence of the Min, Qingyi and Dadu Rivers in Sichuan, China, this statue is an ancient engineering marvel. Construction began in 713 CE under a monk named Hai Tong, who hoped that the Buddha's presence would calm dangerous river currents that threatened passing boats. He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 71 metres tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 28 metres wide, its ears measure nearly 7 metres long and each foot extends 8.5 metres. Drainage channels built inside the statue protect it from erosion, helping explain its remarkable preservation for more than 12 centuries."

Even the central dome, rising 96 metres high, carries meaning: the height honours the year of Hungary's millennium anniversary in 1896. Completed in 1904, the building still dominates Budapest's skyline as a powerful national symbol."

The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes."

        "description": "If you think the alphabet is straightforward, Japan's Irohazaka Road in Nikko will twist that belief right out of you. Named after the old Japanese syllabary 'Iroha,' this mountain pass once had 48 hairpin bends—each curve matched to a character of the alphabet. Today, it's a pair of separate one-way roads—one goes up, the other comes down and both make drivers feel as if they're spelling out a story with every turn."

        "description": "Forget dolphins doing flips or sharks stealing headlines—manatees win hearts by doing, well, almost nothing. And that's the charm. Manatees are found in the warm coastal waters of the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Amazon Basin and West Africa. They can weigh up to 550 kilograms, yet their diet is strictly vegetarian. These whiskered mammals are slow swimmers in a fast-paced world. They cruise at around 5 miles per hour—great for relaxing, not so great when speedboats come charging through. That's why 'no-wake zones,' or sections of waterways with a strict speed limit, are there to keep manatees safe."

        "description": "Of all the plants on Earth, the quiver tree looks the most like a vision from the future. Found in Southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, these striking giants are not true trees but a species of aloe adapted to life under the desert's scorching sun. Their thick trunks store water, while their branches reflect heat, helping them endure harsh conditions. Reaching up to 7 metres in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem. They offer rare perches and nesting sites for birds in landscapes where few other trees exist."

Commissioned by the Flavian emperor Vespasian in 72 CE and finished by his son Titus in 80 CE, this amphitheatre broke tradition with its predecessors that were built into hillsides for natural support. Instead, the Colosseum was a fully free-standing architectural giant. Crafted from stone and concrete, its arches and vaults supported an arena that could host up to 50,000 spectators. Gladiators, exotic animals and even staged sea battles thrilled the crowds, while hidden elevators and trapdoors created sudden, dramatic appearances."

These sandstone pillars, formed around 70 million years ago, are among Germany's most significant natural and cultural landmarks. They captivate visitors with their unique shapes and rich historical significance, attracting thousands each year. The rocks reach heights of up to 35 metres. As early as the Middle Ages, the site was used as a place of worship, as evidenced by a remarkable 12th-century relief carved into the stone depicting the Descent from the Cross. It is the oldest of its kind north of the Alps."

It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either."

Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country. Also known as Little Rainbow Bridge, it shares visual similarities with the iconic Rainbow Bridge arch near Lake Powell—but Corona Arch holds its own in a more peaceful setting."

Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times."

Founded in 1273 by Lady Dervorguilla of Galloway, this Cistercian abbey wasn't just built for monks and prayers—it was built for love. When her husband, John de Balliol, passed away, Dervorguilla had his heart embalmed and placed in a silver casket. She carried it with her everywhere, like a medieval love letter on repeat. When she died, the heart was buried with her at the abbey she named in his memory—Dulce Cor, or 'Sweet Heart.'"

The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama."

These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars."

Symbolising unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 1,400 square metres of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion."

        "description": "Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey."

This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe."

Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes and showing up at every family gathering. The bond may stretch over time and distance, but it seldom fades. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair."

Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings."

The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats."

The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability."

It spends most of its time gliding over open seas and returning to land only to breed. These seabirds, known for their vast and noisy breeding colonies, called gannetries, nest on steep cliffs, remote rocky islands and sea stacks that rise from the ocean."

Beginning this year on July 5 and concluding on July 27, the 2025 race will span 21 stages and over 2,000 miles across France. First held in 1903 to boost newspaper sales, the Tour has grown into cycling's most iconic race. Riders compete in mountain climbs, sprints and time trials, with the race traditionally ending in Paris—though the 2025 edition will once again skip the Champs-Élysées finish, following last year's modifications due to Olympic preparations."

Inspired by that act of resistance, about 2,000 people gathered in London for its first Pride march, walking from Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park. That small march grew into one of the United Kingdom's largest annual events. Today, hundreds of thousands fill the streets, from drag queens and dykes on bikes to queer teens and allies with banners."

Orosei, a town of about 7,000 residents in the Baronie region, is nestled in the Cedrino Valley just over a mile and a half from the sea. Its economy thrives on agriculture, marble quarrying and tourism. This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 miles, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights. Every May, the town celebrates the festivals of Sant'Isidoro and Santa Maria 'e Mare with traditional processions. During the festivities, the local flavours shine—especially in seadas, a special dessert sprinkled with golden strawberry-tree honey."

This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone."

Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day' in the American sense, it's the closest thing to it. Locals celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts and community events. Ottawa, the capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill. Red-and-white flags, maple leaf face paint and singalongs of the national anthem, 'O Canada,' are all part of the day."

This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth."

This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. This amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights."

Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round.

From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore."

Today's image captures a tender moment between a Maasai giraffe mother and her calf in this stunning landscape. The Maasai giraffe is easily recognised by its jagged, irregular spots and inhabits various regions across eastern Africa. It is the largest giraffe species and the tallest land animal on Earth. Males typically weigh up to 1,300 kilograms and can reach heights of 5.5 metres. In the wild, they live around 30 years, often longer in captivity. A notable feature is their long necks, made up of seven vertebrae, which accounts for about one-third of their total height."

Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, beautifully captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen colour vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important."

Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines."

Sea turtles, like this one photographed in Fernando de Noronha, Brazil, have been cruising Earth's oceans since before T-rex was a thing. Today, World Sea Turtle Day, is about recognising these ancient navigators and the role they play in keeping our oceans in balance. Why June 16? The date marks the birthday of American conservationist Archie Carr, known as the 'father of sea turtle conservation.' His work laid the foundation for understanding turtle behaviour and fighting for their protection."

In 1907, Grace Clayton, who lost her father in the Monongah mining disaster in West Virginia, United States, suggested a service to honour fathers who died in the incident. Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States. She sought to pay tribute to her father, an American Civil War veteran who raised six children alone. Her determination sparked a movement, laying the foundation for the day we now dedicate to dads."

Trooping the Colour is a centuries-old military tradition, held each June to mark the official birthday of the reigning monarch—even if their actual birthday is in, say, November. The real reason? The weather's better. No one wants to troop anything through puddles. There's marching, music, horses, salutes—and a good chance of spotting a royal in a bearskin or bonnet."

The 801,163-acre (324,219-hectare) area, originally part of Mexico, became a part of the United States in 1848. Efforts to preserve its beauty began in the 1930s, culminating in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here) and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the United States–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners and modern travellers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park."

It protects the southern 20% of the original Everglades and is home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the Florida panther, American crocodile and West Indian manatee. Often referred to as 'River of Grass,' the park's unique ecosystem, fed by a slow-moving river from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, is a significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds. Everglades National Park is not only a national treasure but also an international one, recognised as a World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance."

Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule."

The architect, Thomas Hamilton, took one look at the steep hill and decided to lean into it—literally—designing a graceful curve that follows the natural contour of the land. He even added a terrace of arched shops on the upper level, creating a sort of two-tiered retail sandwich."

Catch one pausing on an Echinacea flower—like the one photographed at the Rockefeller State Park in New York, United States—and you've hit the jackpot. Skippers aren't your average butterflies. Technically part of the superfamily Papilionoidea, they're often mistaken for moths thanks to their stout bodies and erratic flight patterns. But unlike moths, they're active by day, have clubbed antennae with a hook at the end and wings they usually hold at quirky angles. Their name? It comes from their quick, darting flight."

        "description": "Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the Ebro river, this Catalan village still offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport and even defence. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferryboats and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed."

Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild."

Enter Mona Vale rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched between two beaches—The Basin beach and Mona Vale Beach—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a man-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is approximately 30 metres long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools were also used by large numbers of World War II troops who camped nearby. They are free, open year-round and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing."

Native to Africa, Madagascar and parts of Australia, baobabs have earned their nickname due to their quirky silhouette, but there's much more to them than meets the eye."

But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1912. Now spread across 55 acres (22 hectares), the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom."

While turtles are smaller and built for swimming, tortoises are larger, heavier and adapted for life on land. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats."

Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice."

Lead, zinc, coal, sulphur, barium and silver were extracted from these rugged hills but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly and inefficient process."

Its most recognisable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 2,500 metres tall.

But every May 9, these masters of disguise can't hide from the spotlight. International Chameleon Day celebrates their colour-shifting skills, zippy tongues and wild adaptations. With over 200 species found in diverse habitats, these reptiles don't change colour to match their background. Instead, their shifting shades help regulate body temperature, attract mates and communicate with others. Specialised skin cells, including iridophores, reflect light to create dazzling displays. Some species turn bright to signal aggression, while others adopt subdued tones to avoid attention."

World Donkey Day, established by Dr. Abdul Raziq Kakar, a livestock expert from Pakistan, is all about celebrating these hardworking animals. Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but that's just a misunderstanding. They're actually cautious thinkers. Unlike horses, which might bolt at danger, donkeys take a moment to assess the situation before reacting. From ancient trade routes to modern farms, donkeys have been essential to transportation and agriculture. In many parts of the world, they're still the backbone of rural economies, carrying supplies across difficult terrain where vehicles can't go. Despite their vital role, donkeys face serious challenges. Many endure overwork, poor treatment and abandonment."

The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin."

The beach stays put, but the city transforms into a giant stage during the Brighton Festival—a three-week celebration where art spills out of theatres, dances down alleyways and occasionally juggles fire on the seafront. Started in 1967, the Brighton Festival has grown into one of England's largest curated multi-arts festivals. This year, the fest is taking place from 3 to 26 May in venues across Brighton, Hove and Sussex, featuring 120 events, exhibitions and installations. Each year, the event hands the creative reins to a guest director, often an artist with something fresh to say. From authors to musicians to activists, these directors shape the theme and vibe of the festival. Grammy-nominated, genre-defying musician, composer, and activist Anoushka Shankar was inspired by the theme of 'New Dawn' for this year's programme."

This beautiful square, with its semi-elliptical shape and stunning architecture, was used as the city of Theed on the planet Naboo. The scene where Senator Amidala arrives in Naboo, featuring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, was filmed here. Plaza de España's unique design, with its central building, towers and fountain, adds a touch of magic to the Star Wars universe. This historic square, designed by Aníbal González, was originally built for the Ibero-American Exposition in 1929."

On May 1, Hawaii, United States, celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honours culture, craftsmanship and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root."

Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. In the United Kingdom, jazz flourished in the 1940s, with London's Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, founded in 1959, becoming a legendary venue. British jazz icons like Tubby Hayes and Courtney Pine pushed the genre forward, while the EFG London Jazz Festival remains a major event, drawing international stars and local talent alike."

Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays."

This year, the demand is unreal—840,000+ hopefuls entered the ballot. That's a record-smashing number, with 49% of UK applicants being women and a significant rise in young runners."

This widely celebrated feast honors Saint George, the soldier-saint and dragon slayer, and is observed on April 23—the date traditionally associated with his martyrdom. Saint George rose to prominence in England during the Crusades and the Hundred Years' War, eventually becoming the nation's patron saint in the Tudor period. However, enthusiasm for his feast day declined after the union of England and Scotland in the 18th century. Recognition of Saint George as England's patron saint and the celebration of his day has resurged since the mid-1990s. This revival builds on efforts that began with the Royal Society of St. George in 1894. Since the early 2010s, these initiatives have gained momentum, leading to festivities that increasingly resemble a national holiday in England."

The event was initiated by Jennifer Barlow, a high school student of Midlothian, Virginia, in 2003, to combat light pollution. One of the best places to experience the night sky's beauty is Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California, an International Dark Sky Park. Here, the absence of artificial light allows visitors to see the stars as our ancestors once did. Did you know that light pollution prevents us from seeing most of the stars in the Milky Way? By reducing it, we can reconnect with the universe's beauty and wonder."

        "description": "Happy Easter! Today is a special day for billions of Christians worldwide—a time of renewal, celebration and traditions. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the New Testament. It's also a time for festive traditions, from sunrise services to Easter egg hunts and, of course, the beloved Easter Bunny! Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today in various countries. In German folklore, an egg-laying hare called 'Osterhase' would visit children and leave behind decorated eggs as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings. Over time, this tradition evolved into the Easter baskets filled with chocolates, jellybeans and marshmallows that many families enjoy today. Whether you're enjoying a festive feast, decorating eggs or simply soaking in the beauty of spring, may your Easter be filled with joy and love!"

That's why April 18 is the International Day for Monuments and Sites, an event recognised by UNESCO dedicated to protecting cultural treasures worldwide. This day is all about celebrating our history, raising awareness about endangered sites and making sure future generations can enjoy them too. A remarkable example is Göreme Historical National Park in Cappadocia, Türkiye. It's famous for its 'fairy chimneys'—towering rock formations shaped by volcanic ash and erosion over thousands of years. People even carved homes, churches and entire underground cities into these soft rock formations, some dating back to the 4th century. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world."

Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse."

They often travel in pods and love to check out passing boats whenever they get the chance. But pollution and overfishing threaten their survival, and they need our help. The star of today's image is the Atlantic spotted dolphin—known for the spots on its body, which multiply and become denser with age. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch. The United Kingdom is home to several species, including the bottlenose, common and white-beaked dolphins. Each species helps maintain the ocean's balance, highlighting the need to conserve their habitat."

During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Meanwhile, the streets turn into water battlegrounds, with locals and tourists alike getting soaked in the spirit of renewal. Traditional parades roll through the lanes, and in some places, the 'Lady Songkran' or 'Miss Songkran' contest steals the show, with contestants dressed in stunning Thai outfits."

This period, known as 'tulip mania,' is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained."

As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to a metre long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behaviour that maintains both their dental health and their environment.

Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen."

Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking."

These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a penny—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 3 kilograms."

Mothering Sunday isn't just Britain's version of Mother's Day—it has a history that predates the modern celebration by centuries. In medieval England, it was a religious occasion when people returned to their 'mother church'—the main church or cathedral in their area. This pilgrimage often led to family reunions, giving servants a rare day off to visit home. Naturally, a visit to mum was part of the tradition, and over time, the religious aspect blended with a more personal celebration."

Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, this feathered creature prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. With short legs, it perches upright and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds attach themselves to mixed-species of social gatherers and are often active in the dense understory of the forest canopy."

Today is the Ides of March, a day steeped in Roman history and tradition. The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life."

This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact."

        "description": "Let's be real—the beaches in Bali are beautiful, but the ones in Nusa Penida? That's a whole new vibe. This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honour today."

The tree-climbing lions of the Ishasha Sector have a habit of sprawling across the branches of giant fig trees, as seen in today's image. Experts believe they climb to escape ground-level heat or pesky insects, but these naps make for an unforgettable sight. This vast park spans volcanic craters, open plains and dense forests. A safari here promises encounters with Uganda's incredible wildlife."

Rising 310 metres above England's capital, this glass-clad giant is not just the tallest building in the United Kingdom but also a symbol of modern London. It was designed by Renzo Piano, an Italian architect known for making a statement with high-tech, lightweight and functional designs. Inspired by church spires and ship masts, he envisioned a sleek, tapering structure that would reflect the changing sky. Construction began in 2009, and by 2012, it had officially claimed its title as Western Europe's tallest skyscraper."

From its humble beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate."

Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 13 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive."

Saint David was a 6th-century monk, bishop and preacher who played a key role in spreading Christianity across the country. He founded several religious communities known for their simple, disciplined lifestyles. One of his most famous sayings, 'Gwnewch y pethau bychain,' still resonates today as a reminder that small acts of kindness and faith matter. But why do people wear leeks and daffodils? Legend has it that the saint advised Welsh soldiers to wear leeks on their helmets to distinguish themselves from the enemy in battle against the Saxons. The daffodil, meanwhile, became popular later as a more visually appealing national emblem, especially during the 19th century."

The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,600 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern."

Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."

Once called Jorvik, York was a major Viking settlement, and this festival, which is taking place from 17 to 23 February this year, brings that era to life with battle reenactments, storytelling and hands-on activities. The highlight? Epic clashes of costumed warriors in dramatic, historically accurate battles. For a more peaceful experience, visitors can try axe-throwing, learn rune writing, or explore Viking markets brimming with crafts and treats. Traditional Scandinavian foods and mead-tasting sessions let you feast like a Viking chieftain."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too.

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material."

The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 and 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. They spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival."

But who was Roland? Count Roland was a Frankish military leader during Charlemagne's reign in the 8th century. Legend has it that, after being defeated in battle, Roland cut a gap in the mountains—either to destroy his sword or to catch one last glimpse of France."

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. As we celebrate the anniversary of its establishment today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves, created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

For the first time in the world, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast forward 266 years, the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artefacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes and samurai armour."

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

        "description": "Ever heard of frozen bubbles? Abraham Lake in Alberta, Canada, has them during the winter, and they're not just beautiful—they're science in action. Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum."

Welcome to the Namib desert, spanning thousands of miles across Namibia. Estimated to be 55 million years old, it is believed to be the oldest desert in the world. It also boasts some of the tallest sand dunes on Earth, including the famous 'Big Daddy,' which towers roughly 325 metres; Dune 7, the highest dune in Namibia at 383 metres; and Dune 45, which, at roughly 170 metres, is a favourite among photographers."

Stretching more than 13,000 miles and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength."

        "description": "Are you ready to rock the new year? Today is Old Rock Day, a day for celebrating and learning about old rocks and fossils. Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history. The United Kingdom, with its rich geological diversity, provides a front-row seat to the ancient forces that shaped our planet. On the Jurassic Coast in Dorset and East Devon, rocks over 180 million years old tell tales of dinosaurs, ancient seas and volcanic activity. And don't forget the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its impressive columns of basalt."

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or a burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are found in forests and open woodlands. There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York and Florida in the United States, and even parts of the Middle East. In the United Kingdom, some of these birds were brought in as exotic pets and either escaped or were released. Parakeets are often spotted in flocks, chattering melodiously or indulging in their favourite fruits, seeds and blossoms. Their quick, agile flight and playful nature make them a delight in the wild or as beloved pets. Known for their distinctive calls that echo through the air, these birds are also capable of mimicking human speech."

Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and nearly 300 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 169 miles north of Hanoi, this waterfall has gradually worn away its crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall."

Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: JRR Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip."

This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favour throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

From torchlight processions to street ceilidhs, Hogmanay is the New Year's Eve celebration that says, 'Why settle for one night of celebration when you can have three?' The term 'Hogmanay' has murky origins—some link it to the French 'hoguinané,' which means 'gala day,' others to Norse or Gaelic roots. But what it means today is clear: an unmissable celebration filled with fireworks, folk songs and feasting. This year, the festivities kicked off on December 29 with a dramatic torchlight procession."
