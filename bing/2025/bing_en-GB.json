People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote."

        "description": "Around 60 miles southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji. The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,600 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern."

The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson's idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 190-metre-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

These semi-aquatic animals are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."

The highlight? Epic clashes of costumed warriors in dramatic, historically accurate battles. For a more peaceful experience, visitors can try axe-throwing, learn rune writing, or explore Viking markets brimming with crafts and treats. Traditional Scandinavian foods and mead-tasting sessions let you feast like a Viking chieftain."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

        "description": "Being the 'black sheep' isn't always a bad thing—just ask the Scottish Blackface, seen here in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material."

The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 and 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. They spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival."

In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone. It is still one of the deepest historic wells in Germany."

Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home."

It all began in 1908 when President Theodore Roosevelt designated the area as a national monument. Later in 2013, Pinnacles earned its status as a national park. As we celebrate the anniversary of its establishment today, let's take a moment to appreciate this landscape. This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves, created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

For the first time in the world, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast forward 266 years, the museum houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artefacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Marbles, the Benin Bronzes and samurai armour."

Stroll through narrow streets lined with flower-filled balconies, visit the picturesque church of Santa María de la Mesa, or simply relax and take in the breathtaking views. Zahara is also a gateway to adventure—activities like hiking, cycling and kayaking are only a little of what the village has to offer."

As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

Although rocks are common, few of us take the time to consider how amazing they are. Forged in volcanoes or moulded by millennia of pressure, these solid masses of minerals hold the key to understanding how our planet formed. Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms, which give scientists clues about what creatures and plants have lived on Earth during its 4.5-billion-year history. The United Kingdom, with its rich geological diversity, provides a front-row seat to the ancient forces that shaped our planet. On the Jurassic Coast in Dorset and East Devon, rocks over 180 million years old tell tales of dinosaurs, ancient seas and volcanic activity. And don't forget the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its impressive columns of basalt."

In the United Kingdom, some of these birds were brought in as exotic pets and either escaped or were released. Parakeets are often spotted in flocks, chattering melodiously or indulging in their favourite fruits, seeds and blossoms. Their quick, agile flight and playful nature make them a delight in the wild or as beloved pets. Known for their distinctive calls that echo through the air, these birds are also capable of mimicking human speech."

This year, the festivities kicked off on December 29 with a dramatic torchlight procession."

        "description": "Today's image shows an endangered green sea turtle swimming in the waters off New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Found along the coastlines of over 140 countries, they nest in more than 80 countries all year round. Green sea turtles have been recorded in Britain and Ireland, including the south and west coasts of England, and the north-west of Scotland and Shetland. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrate. This coral can grow to around 2 metres and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over."

        "description": "Lake Bled in Slovenia gets plenty of attention in summer, but winter? That's when things slow down in the best way. The lake's emerald waters take on a softer tone, and Bled Island, with its quaint church, looks straight out of a winter fairytale, as seen in today's image. The 1.3-mile lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

        "description": "As the last notes of Christmas carols linger in the air, Boxing Day arrives. This day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, Canada and several Commonwealth countries. In the past, it was customary for the wealthy to give boxes filled with gifts to their servants on the day after Christmas. The tradition evolved into a day for charitable giving to the less fortunate. Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday about enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches."
