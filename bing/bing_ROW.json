Originally known Place d'Armes and later Plaza de Armas under Spanish rule, it served a key site for military parades and public executions in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, the former military plaza was renamed Jackson Square in honour of Andrew Jackson, the hero of the battle and the seventh president of the United States."

        "description": "Today's image features the southern yellow-billed hornbill, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. This medium-sized bird measures about 48 to 50 centimetres in length with a wingspan of 60 centimetres and weighs 150 to 200 grams. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. They nest in natural tree cavities, with the female sealing herself inside using a mud wall, leaving only a small slit through which the male feeds her and the chicks. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah."

Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students. According to legend, an emperor's former wife, out of devotion, transformed into a tigress and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and emerged in eight incarnations, which is why it is known as the 'Tiger's Nest.' Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. There are three main routes to reach the monastery, with the most popular path winding through a forest decorated with prayer flags. The hike is demanding but rewarding, providing breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape."

        "description": "Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Their fur isn't truly white; it's translucent, reflecting visible light and allowing them to blend seamlessly into their snowy environment. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. Protecting polar bears means protecting their home—let's work together to slow the effects of climate change and safeguard their future."

The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote. The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth."

For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. Mount Fuji is one of Japan's cherished 'Three Holy Mountains' along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. In 2013, it was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, highlighting its cultural importance."

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 192-metre-tall structure that has become the symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the title of the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength."

These penguins, found in coastal Patagonia, are known for their distinctive black and white bands and their loud, braying calls. They also mate with the same partner every year. They dig burrows near the coast to lay their eggs and raise their chicks. The male returns to burrows he used the year before and waits for his partner, who can recognise him by his voice alone. Their diet mainly consists of small fish, squid and krill. They can dive up to 50 metres depth to forage for food. In winter, they migrate north to warmer waters, sometimes reaching as far as southern Brazil. These penguins are highly social and often seen in large colonies, where they communicate with each other through their distinctive calls. Fun fact: Penguins can drink seawater because they have a special gland that filters out the salt!"

        "description": "At Lake Tyrrell, southern Australia, the sky meets the Earth in a dazzling display. The state of Victoria's largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate change caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in around 5 centimetres of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 18,000 hectares, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including Mallee reptiles, kangaroos and emus."

They weigh around 1.5 kilograms and can grow up to 1.5 metres in length. These reptiles are the only lizards in the world that forage in the sea, diving to graze on algae growing on submerged rocks. Researchers believe that both Galápagos land iguanas and marine iguanas evolved from a common ancestor that likely rafted from Central or South America. They've adapted in remarkable ways, from flattened tails for swimming to salt glands that allow them to expel seawater by sneezing."

The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 17 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musician and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule."

It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

Rising from the waters of the Tasman Sea, these rugged islets became well known around the world after they were featured in a Windows 10 desktop screensaver in 2015. At low tide, curious wanderers can explore caves and rock pools and often spot lounging seals."

With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material."

The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 to 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. These little champs spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival."

In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone. It is still one of the deepest historic wells in Germany."

These stripes aren't just for show—they act as camouflage against predators by disrupting the outline of individual zebras within a herd. When it comes to food, they are not fuddy. Grass is their main dish, but they'll munch on leaves and barks if that's what's on the menu. They have a tough digestive system that lets them make the most of whatever they find, even if it's not the freshest. Plains zebras live in family groups, usually led by a dominant stallion, with mares and their foals forming the core of the herd."

Located in the geothermal area beside the Hvítá River in Iceland, this geyser erupts every 6 to 10 minutes, shooting hot water 14 to 20 metres into the air, sometimes erupting up to 40 metres. The geothermal valley is also home to a variety of geothermal wonders, including bubbling mud pools, steaming fumaroles and other geysers."

Created in 1889 in honour of Queen Margherita of Savoy, the Pizza Margherita, with its ingredients reminiscent of the Italian flag—red tomatoes, white mozzarella and green basil—became a symbol of Italian conviviality, culture and tradition."

This park isn't only a natural wonder but a historical treasure, with fossilised human footprints dating back as far as 23,000 years, some of the oldest in North America. White Sands was established as a protected site in 1933 by President Hebert Hoover. What better way to celebrate than by immersing yourself in its beauty? Enjoy activities like hiking, sledding down the dunes or taking a scenic drive. Whether for its rich history or jaw-dropping sunsets, White Sands National Park is a wish-list destination that will leave you in awe."

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

On the other side is a pebble beach, where the unrelenting waves sculpt the landscape. Here, the salty spray carried by the wind and the thunder of waves crashing against cliffs serve as constant reminders of nature's raw force."

Consider it an unsung hero of the 19th-century Welsh maritime life. As for Ynys Llanddwyn, it is not your average tidal island. The area is steeped in history—especially the legend of St. Dwynwen, the Welsh saint of love. People once visited the island seeking her blessings. You'll also find old pilot cottages and remnants of a life-saving station, all pointing to the island's long-standing link to the sea."

Although it was originally conceived in the 3rd century BCE, some of its most famous sections were built during the Ming dynasty between the 14th and 17th centuries CE. This UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases advanced ancient engineering and remains a symbol of Chinese history and culture. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder! The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength."

There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York and Florida in the United States, and even parts of the Middle East. Parakeets are often spotted in flocks, chattering melodiously or indulging in their favourite fruits, seeds and blossoms. Their quick, agile flight and playful nature make them a delight in the wild or as beloved pets. Known for their distinctive calls that echo through the air, these birds are also capable of mimicking human speech."

Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 28 metres tall and 298 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 272 kilometres north of Hanoi, this waterfall has gradually worn away its crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall."

This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840, when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."

Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year on the first day of January. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

This over 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

A few humble strings of lights soon turned into a full-blown spectacle, growing over the years to include iconic scenes, nautical motifs and Cornish themes. Today, the lights, switched on from December until early January, span the entire harbour, wrapping buildings, boats and even the water's edge in a soft glow."

Open to the public during the day and 24/7 for hotel guests, the pier is an ideal place to take in panoramic coastal views, watch whales and surfers playing, do some fishing or bathe in glorious coastal sunsets. Pacific Beach also has a lively restaurant, bar and club scene if eggnog isn't your thing. There are certainly colder places to spend Christmas, but perhaps no place cooler than Crystal Pier."

Towering over the landscape are two peaks: Klínovec in the Czech Republic, standing at 1,244 metres and Germany's Fichtelberg at 1,215 metres. Centuries of human activity have left their mark here, creating a rich cultural landscape. Mining has shaped the terrain with its tips, dams, ditches and sinkholes, altering habitats for plants and animals. Remarkably, this region was also the birthplace of the transformation of mining and metallurgy from small-scale craftsmanship to large-scale industry—a crucial prelude to the Industrial Revolution."

As part of the Terai Arc Landscape Programme, the park is among the thirteen protected areas targeted for preservation and restoration. The overarching goal of this programme is ambitious yet crucial: to safeguard three of the most iconic terrestrial species, namely the tiger, the Asian elephant and the great one-horned rhinoceros."

        "description": "Today, we're in Austria's fourth-largest city—Salzburg, a place that never goes out of style. This city, shaped by centuries of change, owes much of its charm to its medieval roots and Baroque brilliance. The Altstadt also known as the 'old town,' is a treasure trove of architecture that tells a story. Narrow cobblestone streets guide you to landmarks like the Hohensalzburg Fortress, a symbol of resilience that has loomed over the city since the 11th century. Salzburg Cathedral is a striking example of Baroque craftsmanship, with its twin tower defining the skyline. Salzburg's architectural legacy is not just about buildings but the music within them. This is, after all, Mozart's birthplace, and his childhood home still attracts admirers."

Well, legend has it that Lake Misurina, pictured here, in Italy's Dolomites, was born from the sorrow of a giant named Sorapis. At more than 1,740 metres above sea level, it is the largest natural lake in the Cadore region, with its perimeter stretching more than two kilometres. The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

With its long, tapered tail and a small head resembling a hawk, the northern hawk-owl is a striking sight. Known for its high-pitched, sharp call, the owl's vocalisations are simple yet distinctive. It often emits a series of whistling hoots, making it stand out among its owl relatives."

Fun fact: Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first US ambassador to Mexico, introduced these vibrant plants to America in the 1820s after discovering them while exploring the Taxco region in Guerrero. The small yellow structures found at the centre of the vibrant bracts are the actual blooms. These flowers, grouped within cyathia, are crucial to the plant's reproductive process. Interestingly, the hues of poinsettia bracts result from photoperiodism, a light-sensitive process crucial for their colour transformation."

These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981 by the California State Legislature."

It is the coldest, driest and windiest of the Earth's continents, with temperatures plunging as low as -80 degrees Celsius. Vast ice sheets and glaciers found here hold about 70% of the world's fresh water. The waters are dotted with icebergs, as seen in today's image, which drift across the Southern Ocean and gradually melt over time. Species like Emperor and Adélie penguins, along with seals, mites, roundworms and moss piglets, have made this icy habitat their permanent home."

Built in the mid-15th century by Sir Colin Campbell, the fortress sits on the northeastern shore of Loch Awe, the longest loch in Scotland, stretching approximately 25 kilometres. The Campbells of Glenorchy, a powerful clan, made Kilchurn their base for generations, adding to the original structure over time. From its strategic location, the castle controlled access to the Highlands, making it an essential stronghold in Scottish conflicts. In the 17th century, Kilchurn took a more defensive role, being converted into a barracks during the Jacobite uprisings. But as fate would have it, Kilchurn wasn't destined to stay battle-ready forever. By the 1700s, it was abandoned and began its slow crumble into the ruin you see today. Even though it's no longer a fortress for soldiers, its craggy remains still inspire awe and admiration."

The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."

From there, they were spread to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then further afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood and fruit for millennia."

They're also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 60 kilometres per hour. Giraffes are common in east Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands and reserves."

Featured here is a pair of African lion cubs sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa. Typically born in litters of one to four, they are tucked away in a secluded den for safety. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride. This isn't just a casual interaction—it's an important moment for them to socialise and find their place in the group. During this time, they learn how to behave within the pride, which helps shape their roles as they grow up. After they hit six months, they begin to accompany adults on hunting trips, learning essential skills and tricks of the trade through real-life adventures."

With its 17 majestic arches resting on 16 piers, it measures 486 metres in length and showcases the ingenuity of its time. Initially named 'Pont Louis XVIII' upon its opening, it was quickly adopted by the people of Bordeaux as the 'Pont de Pierre,' meaning 'stone bridge,' likely due to its sturdy construction."

The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills.

        "description": "Amidst the dense cedars and Sitka spruces of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, the Vancouver Coastal Sea wolf roams free. These canines, seen in British Columbia in today's image, thrive in this ecosystem, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the grey wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

With a labyrinth of ecosystems that range from glacier-capped mountains to temperate rainforests, the park is a home for wildlife as well as a retreat for thrill-seekers and history buffs. Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image. Recognised as an International Biosphere Reserve, this national park features 900 kilometres of trails, where hikers can embark on a trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach."

This village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described it as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, featured in today's image."

When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage."

The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius."

It stretches along the southern coast from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset. This area is like a giant natural history museum, with rocks and cliffs that reveal 185 million years of Earth's history. But what really steals the show are the fossils, especially those of belemnites and ammonites—extinct marine creatures—that are pictured here. Mary Anning, a pioneering fossil hunter who combed these shores, paved the way for our current understanding of fossils. Now, it's your turn to embark on a journey through time."

Every July, roughly 2 million of these determined grazers, along with zebras and other herbivores, set off on a journey to the Masai Mara in Kenya in search of lush pastures and fresh water. The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize. One of the most dramatic moments of the migration is the crossing of the Mara River. Thousands of wildebeests gather at the riverbank, aware that danger lurks beneath the surface—the crocodiles—not to mention the lions and leopards that patrol the banks."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

The landscape is a stunning tapestry of broad, rolling hills interspersed with deep valleys and steep-walled river canyons. In the southern and western parts of the plateau, wide valleys shaped by glacial activity have created some of Cape Breton's most fertile agricultural land. Meanwhile, the interior and southern regions are blanketed in cool, damp deciduous forests, which transform into a vibrant display of autumn colours."

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters off Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 3-metres long and weigh more than 1,179 kilograms; during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Skaftafell, once a thriving farm and now a preservation area, has been formed over thousands of years by the fierce interplay of volcanic fire and glacial water. Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Vatnajökull—the second largest ice cap in Europe—stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater. Surrounded by dark lava columns that resemble a heart from afar, this waterfall inspired the design of Iceland's National Theatre and the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík. Skaftafell's hiking trails range from easy walks to challenging climbs, so there's something for everyone. While the daylight hours may be shorter in this season, there's a bright"

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. So, whenever you see their fuzzy heads bobbing in the waves, remember, you're witnessing a story of nature's triumph."

Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 45 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

They must surface to inhale and exhale stale air, which they do through blowholes and not their mouths. How long they can hold their breath depends on the species; some can go for 3 to 7 minutes, while others can stay submerged for up to 20 minutes. Because they must always surface, half of dolphins' brains are always active, meaning they never completely fall asleep. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing."

        "description": "Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline. Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt."

Nestled in the western foothills of the Canigou massif in the Pyrénées-Orientales, this is an eleventh-century Romanesque marvel. The abbey has two churches built in the first Romanesque style: the lower church, dedicated to St. Mary, and the upper church, dedicated to St. Martin. This historic structure is catalogued in the Base Mérimée, an architectural heritage database managed by the French Ministry of Culture. The original appearance of the cloister is now hard to envision due to extensive restorations carried out between 1900 and 1920. Originally, the cloister had two levels: the lower level, constructed in the early 11th century, featured vaulted galleries with semicircular arches and was free of ornamentation. Today, only three heavily restored galleries remain, missing much of their original character."

With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects."

Known for its dynamic blend of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, the city is also celebrated for its multicultural and cosmopolitan character. Indigenous peoples have inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years. Following the contentious Toronto Purchase, the British established York in 1793, which was later renamed Toronto and incorporated as a city in 1834. Geographically, Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes in surface area, spanning 19,010 square kilometres, yet it surpasses Lake Erie in volume. It's the 13th largest lake globally, with a shoreline of 1,145 kilometres."

An impressive wingspan of 38–43 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 61 centimetres, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. The lower stretches of the river, known as the Tideway, extend up to Teddington Lock, reflecting its extensive tidal reach. From Oxford to its estuary, the river descends 55 metres. Although the Thames flows through some of the drier regions of mainland Britain and is heavily tapped for drinking water, its discharge is relatively low compared to its size."

Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life."

These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage."

Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name of these striking birds might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanour when they're walking."

Pictured here is a hybrid coaster that combines wood and steel—Hakugei, the White Whale of the country. Once known as White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track. Its metamorphosis not only revved up its velocity and propelled it to new heights but also introduced gravity-defying inversions. So, if you find yourself in Japan, brave the Hakugei—take the plunge and emerge with a tale as epic as the ride itself."

Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom."

Other features include the Adriatic's safest and most expansive natural harbour, which has 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties.
